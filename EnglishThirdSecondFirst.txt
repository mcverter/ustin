       <p>I, Pascal Ustin Dubuisson, son of Haiti -- a country where success is a challenge,     and the right to eat, to educate yourself, and to progress a privilege -- made the decision to leave my country not only for a better future, but also for a secure future.</p>   
           <p>"As far as you want to reach, as high as you want to climb, everything begins with a single step"     In order to reach the goal, referred to in the previous statement, I took a grand voyage     so that I could make my life worthwhile.     The desire to have something better gave me     a strength and a determination that permitted me     to confront such a great challenge, one that thousands of persons did not survive.     This experience has taught me that, in life,     if you must dive into the darkness in order to obtain the light, you should not waver;     because the best decisions are often the most difficult to take,     because they always have grave consequences.</p>   
 
       <p>===================== CHAPTER 1: SURVIVORS Citizens of the World =====================</p>   
       <p>From the moment we depart,     all of us who have decided to leave our places of origin     live dark, difficult, complicated, uncertain moments and     even though making this miserable journey felt like torture,     we can still say that we are survivors.</p>   
       <p>The Republic of Haiti, a Caribbean country,     located on the Western side of the island of Hispaniola,     adjoining the Dominican Republic, has a surface area     of over 10,000 square miles and had a population of over 10 million in 2015. Its political and cultural capital is Port-au-Prince.     It was gravely damaged by the January 12 2010 earthquake.     According to The World Factbook, eighty percent of     the population lives in poverty due to climactic conditions,     and two-thirds depend upon agriculture and fish. (USTIN: NOT CLEAR. ARE THE FISH && AGRICULTURE CONNECTED WITH THE POVERTY AND CLIMATE) It was an formerly French colony and was the first black country to declare its independence in 1804.     Sadly, life expectancy rarely exceeds 52 years. Only 1 in 150 Haitians receive a salary.     Fifty percent of Haitians depend upon remittances received from relatives living abroad.     It is a country rich in gastronomy yet ironically its children live in     extreme poverty caused by insecurity and natural disasters.     Its politics are moderate.     As far as education goes, Haiti contends with (TRATARSE DE) a very intelligent and proud people with few opportunities,     which provokes Haitians to migrate     to diverse parts of the world     with the intention of helping their children better to prepare academically,     thus constituting the so-called "diaspora" of Haitians living abroad.</p>   
       <p>Since the 7.3 magnitude earthquake began at 4:53PM on January 12, 2010,     the country has confronted a chaotic situation,     with around 300,000 dead: brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers,     children, and friends lost their lives in this tragedy, considered a dark day in Haiti.   
       <p>     Some countries came to help,     although this led to malicious rumors about who received the aid money.     The only thing the Haitian people had to depend upon was God.</p>   
       <p>Haitians chose Brazil as the first country for seeking asylum and they traveled there in great numbers.     Thousands crossed the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Peru,     to be able to reach Brazil with the aspiration of changing their living conditions.     From 2010 to 2014, Brazil was ranked among the world's largest economies     with its currency, the *real*, worth forty cents to the dollar.     Haitians valued this unstable currency even more by Haitians     because they had been so impacted by unemployment.     With a salary of a thousand *reales*, Haitians had to pay rent for their families, among other expenses.     At the beginning of 2015, everything began to change:     the economy contracted after the 2015 World Cup and therefore the Haitians,     unfortunately, began to lose their jobs.</p>   
       <p>Still people hoped the situation would improve and that things could change;     however, the dollar followed its course and continued to resist the economic situation until the next year. (UNCLEAR) The Haitians saw that the situation was getting worse every moment,     so they made the decision to leave the country in search of something better.     Their eyes turned towards the United States.     Not all Haitians had family members there;     nevertheless they made the decision to leave     just like those had relatives to receive them in that country.</p>   
       <p>It was possible to live in Brazil,     but the duty to help one's family was stronger,     so remaining in Brazil and waiting was not an option;     rather, one had to look for a better quality of life.     What we did was not going to change the amount of misery in Haiti,     nevertheless the support of ten dollars     would make a big difference for our parents     The majority of Haitians who live in Haiti     depend on other people who find themselves in the United States, Brazil, France, Ecuador, Venezuela, etc --     people who had overcome their economic problems, or at least, who were stable and did not need to struggle.</p>   
       <p>Before leaving Brazil, many saw that     it was necessary to change their nationality from Haitian to that of an African country     in order to be able to cross certain countries.     The first ones who went on the way were charged     with giving advice to the others and teaching tricks to avoid deportation.</p>   
       <p>Families, even though they were not physically present, traveled with you,     because thanks to their support and their small financial contributions of each one,     it was possible to take those dangerous roads towards the exit of Brazil,     to cross Chile, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Darien Gap     (the roadless jungle between Colombia and Panama), Costa Rica,     Nicaragua, Guatemala, Mexico,and the United States of America.</p>   
       <p>     This story has been lived by thousands of     citizens of the world searching for a better life in the United States</p>

   Chapter 2: Peru - Ecuador
       <p>Money is always right</p>   
        <p>We mostly lived in South America, the majority coming from Brazil.     There was no way to calculate how much the voyage would cost,     it was not possible to speak of an exact amount because     everything depended upon the traffickers, better known as the "coyotes."     Peru was situated as the first meeting place for the majority of migrants,     who were not only Haitians; there were persons from between     the majority of migrants, who were not only Haitians:     there were persons from Senegal, Congo, Ghana, Pakistan, among others.     We were speaking different languages and came from different cultures,     but we all had the same objective: to reach the United States.     This period of coexistence gave us the opportunity to make new friends,     allowing us to create a sense of harmony, one that might even be called familiar.</p>   
       <p>A friend and I left together from a place called Canoas, located in the south of Brazil,     it was the exit route to cross fewer countries.</p>   
       <p>We crossed Peru in three or four days by bus, passing from city to city     in order to cross the border of Ecuador.     We were very tired, but a great hope nourished our hearts.     In Peru we felt very uneasy because we were illegal, traveling with a lot of stress,     being careful not only around the police but also around thieves who tried     to take advantage of us in order to steal our belongings.     Therefore we used different techniques to safeguard the money     that we carried from Brazil; some used their shoes,     others their deodorants, others soaps and other personal items</p>   
       <p>When we arrived in Lima, the capital of Peru,     we started to divide ourselves which impeded my group     because we did not want to continue without the others.     But not all of us agreed --     most were impatient to advance to the Ecuadorian border.     On this border we began to encounter human trafficking,     because we were not allowed to cross Ecuador without a visa.     Therefore, we had to pay someone to cross this stretch     and we began to contact some "coyotes" who could help us.     These people met us in the hotel where we were and     one of them assured us that it was going to go well.     These people are incredibly skilled at manipulating you     and making you to make you enter into a confidence (AWKWARD BUT NEEDED FOR WORD PLAY). We did not have confidence in them.     but neither did we have another option.     We had to try it.</p>   
       <p>We knew a great number of Haitians who had tried many times, but because they failed, they were returned to     Peru.     Because the Ecuadorian police were so strict on that border,     it was not so easy to cross.</p>   
       <p>This was our first attempt.     We did not know how many times we would have to try,     because the police were so brutal.     It was helpful that many of the     "coyotes" had friends among the customs police.     They told us that everything was going to turn out fine:     we should leave Peru in the evening     but then the coyote decided that we should cross in the afternoon, because in the evening the authorities performed more vigilance. (AWK)</p>   
       <p>Eight of us carried out the voyage,     one of them had two cars     and a friend of his a motorcycle in front,     about a mile and a half away,     and he was in charge of communicating with his police friends,     who did not yet know all of us.</p>   
       <p>After we entered,     he brought us to his wife's house to show us some things     which other Haitians, who had previously passed through there,     had left behind.     In an hour or so, they told us that it was time to leave for the capital.     The truck was ready to leave.     Most of those who were expected were already inside,     only about ten persons were missing.     Throughout the trip we worried because we knew     about the situation in Ecuador.     We did not know what to do with our fear of being caught.     We had a great deal of anxiety.     Nevertheless, we had to have trust.</p>   
       <p>Every day one brought with oneself one's own fears,     one's own dreads, one's own insecurities.     One of the things that fear can do is to paralyze you.     Conquering fear was not easy for us     In the movie “Rocky”, the main character said that     fear is a fire inside of us:     if we control it we stay hot to continue fighting,     but if we do not control it, IT will spread and devour us.     That much is very true.     For that reason, we were forced to control each emotion and     it seemed that each time a new one rose up in us,     we had to fight it.</p>   
       <p>Many of us consider ourselves brave men.     Here, in this forced adventure, we discovered feelings     we had not experienced and which we had to confront to be able to continue.</p>   
       <p>     Everything was calm the night of the voyage.     There were no setbacks in the road.     The night was very long for us. No one could sleep.     When we arrived in Quito, the capital,     we saw one hundred migrants who had departed from many different parts of the world     The group I came with and I did not want to wait around,     knowing that we did not have any authorization.     We stopped a taxi to ask the driver     if he could bring us to the border with Columbia. He told us that this was illegal.     Nevertheless, he recommended a friend who could take us</p>   
       <p>There were many "coyotes."     In each city we crossed, they benefited the most from     the earnings they received from people like us.     They were pleased to help us with the economic question,     not because they had a big altruistic heart.     They made us believe in things that did not exist     with the aim of making us pay them more money     For example, they told us that the police     would take our money and frightened us by saying     that they would telling us that     they would harm us.     This was just a way of forcing us to pay more.</p>   
       <p>When we took the taxi to start the next endeavor in earnest,     the driver knew where and how to get there quickly     to avoid the police.     It was inevitable that we would encounter one and so it was:     on the road we encountered the police.     They stopped us. The driver had told us that we should     speak French with them, because if not, we would have to return     to Peru, and we were already so close to Columbia     And when the police arrived, they asked the driver why     license plates had a different digits than those close to the border,     and the driver told them that he had only come up there     to bring French people to Columbia.</p>   
       <p>The police asked for our papers.     We acted like we did not know how to speak Spanish,     so we spoke French and offered money to the officers     so that we could leave. Fortunately, nobody was watching     and they accepted the money and allowed us to continue    </p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-4.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      Barely in Peru, so many people were already so depleted.      They could find nowhere better to rest than a bus terminal.     </figcaption>    </figure>
       <p>This facet was very complicated because we knew     that returning to Ecuador would just waste our time and money,     and we were only six hours away from Columbia.     On the road, we stopped many times     but fortunately there were no police in sight.     When we were close to the border,     the driver told us that he could not continue with us due     to police security issues.     He let us out the taxi and     told us that we had to look for a way to continue.     There were many people waiting there.     When we arrived to the border, it was all very strange,     we were very stressed and felt many unpleasant feelings.</p>

   Chapter 3: Columbia
       <p>A risky start</p>   
       <p>In life you have two options: 1) go to bed and dream or 2) get up from your bed to realize your dreams.     And that is what I did.     Your humble servant took root in Brazil,     where he worked in a restaurant as a waiter from midnight until to 7 AM,     a job that paid 1300 reales a month.     I come from Haiti.     I was born in Port-au-Prince within a dysfunctional family,     formed only by my mother, a sister and a brother. For matters of fate, (AWK!!! things of destiny? reasons of fate? Out of fortune? Esp bc <br><br>PARAGRAPH<br><br> ends with "luck" and     risk/gamble is motif throughout) we separated and I was taken to grow up by the side of my grandmother     who died when I was twenty years old.     When I was twenty-three, after staying around for only three years,     I decided to leave for Brazil to find my luck.</p>   
       <p>According to Wikipedia,     the border between Brazil and Columbia is a continuous 1,021.7 mile international boundary     that completely delimits it.     The borderline crosses 502.6 miles of river and canals, and 380.3 miles of conventional borders, (LINEAS CONVENCIONALES?) and 138.7 miles of waterways. [footnote]</p>   
       <p>[footnote] FOOTNOTE: (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontera_entre_Brasil_y_Colombia,     accessed September 1, 2017)</p>   
       <p>Some months before entering Columbia     we had to pay a lot of money to cross the border.     We spent between 300 and 500 dollars each.     The government of Columbia was one of the governments that,     seeing the arrival of so many foreigners from different nations,     took the opportunity to offer us an entry document     that permitted us to stay in the country     for twenty-two days or up to a month.</p>   
       <p>However, at that moment the men could not cross,     only pregnant women and children had this right,     and could cross the border without a problem.     All the rest were condemned to cross over a hill.     This mountain was like a cave of thieves,     so much so that each family that lived there     had a firearm as personal protection for themselves,     for whatever emergency.     This was their of taking care of themselves.     because the police had withdrawn so far away from this village.</p>   
       <p>Crossing the hill took us about four hours, it was so long.     Some Colombians had good hearts --     even thought the citizens had to defend themselves from invaders,     without even knowing us they tried to help us to cross with their carts , but it was in vain because the hill was too steep (PESADA?) and the carts could not climb it.     They, in order to help out the migrants, thought up a way to put people underneath the trucks,     or to put bags of trash or rice on top of individuals, but it was useless.     They were found out.</p>   
       <p>Seeing what was happening, we all had a meeting to make a decision about what would be beneficial to our power to     arrive</p>   
       There was not much to think about, we only had one road to follow, the dangerous one -- where, to start, you had to    pay ten dollars to the Colombian who was in charge. And so it was.    Unfortunately, we believed that this would be the only payment we would have to give, but no, on this road we had to    pay for everything, most unjustly, you pay for necessary things such as sitting down, drinking water, going to the    bathroom, resting.    Those abusive Colombians had mentioned to us     that they knew that the migrants were rich,     that without money, you could not cross ten countries     to reach the border of Tijuana.     In a few words, if we did not have a lot of money to begin with,     we could not have left the place where we came from.<br>     Nothing is more wrong that this thought.
         <p>As happens to all human beings in an unknown situation, suspicion surges within us; nevertheless we do not      show it. Haitians are very tough and foolish people. We have a gene that define us as strong, and not weak,      in the face of adversity, even our skin can resist the environment-- we can endure the pain.</p>    
         <p>Luckily, this hill was not really a great obstacle.      We knew beforehand what awaited us,      but my race is very communicative      and all our acquaintances who had already      made the journey      had told us how and where and what      we were going to have to pass through.      That is exactly how we knew the roads, from the information which they gave us and we knew perfectly that      nothing would be more dangerous and difficult than passing the Darien Gap jungle in Panama.      There we would encounter truly different challenges</p>    
         <p>It was a place where the we would have to pass through,      without question,      and where we knew that most of us would confront      their strengths and weaknesses, their securities and insecurities.      It was the place where undoubtedly      we would come to regret that we had left our apparent comfort</p>    
         <p>Already signed up for the journey,      I delayed the group because I was unable to walk      because the climb was too very broad, (ANCHA? WHY?)      complicated and tangled.      I did not expect that this road would be was so exhausting and tortuous.      Even thought I was young, I felt like my lungs were going to explode.     <p>I was never an athlete, so I was not in good shape and,      at that moment, my physique could no longer take it,      I thought I could not continue any longer.</p>    
         <p>In the distance we could see several persons, so very far away that we could not call them.      Although they would not have been able to hear us and, moreover, we could not yell because we were out of breath      The only thing that would happen is that we would wear out our last strength      and would be unable to restore them because we had no water.      We had for gotten how long the road was going to be.      We felt cheated and angry because the guides --      maybe not to frighten us, we don't know, or through simple malevolence (incompetence?) --      lied to us,      telling us that we would walk for about twenty minutes.      Suddenly, they stopped us.      The “coyotes” did not want to advance because there were police ahead.      They abandoned us in the middle of nowhere, hungry and thirsty,      shamelessly,      without an iota of kindness,      telling us that we would have to continue alone.</p>    
         <p>The path we followed was tortuous.      The time came when we believed that      the "coyotes" had prepared a trap for us and that      at any moment, they would turn us over to thieves      to take from us the little that we had.      Emotions shook like a wheel of fortune with incredible velocity.      We thought thousands of things,      among them all the ways we could die alone, in an unknown place,      where nobody would come to us to give us a decent burial,      because it would be hard for our families to find us.</p>    
         <p>We thought about all of the possible accidents which could befall us to which we had no way to respond      Being in a moment of that nature, where uncertainty and confusion press down, made us unhappy with everyone.      However, despite everything our own demons were telling us, nothing like that happened.      Thank God.</p>    
         <p>After a moment, we saw a truck. The sense of happiness we had was like when a child celebrates his first birthday and feels amazed with everything he sees.      Well, it was with this capacity for amazement that life returned to our bodies.      We approached the driver and asked him      if he could bring us bring us to the way out,      he informed us that the exit was very far away.      He kindly told us that we should wait for his return      ad then he would take us to the main road.      We thought for some seconds and reacted like when      a child opens their gift and it is not what they wanted.      We decided at that moment to move from there      because the road was neither very nice nor trustworthy</p>    
         <p>Fortunately, after forty minutes walking, the van returned      carrying many potatoes and      the driver told us that we could get on.      In this way we arrived to the main road.      Imagine that we paid the “coyotes” for taking across a road      for six hours      when they did not walk for even a single hour.      They received in total more than 120 dollars for each one of us      and spent forty minutes with us.</p>    
         <p>When we arrived at the main road,      the driver told us that he could not take us far due to the military,      and that he did not want to get in trouble.      We understood. It makes sense.      Who wants to ride with illegal migrants in their car      and go to prison or be punished for an act of compassion?      So we got off and took a taxi to take us to the migration office.      The offices were very close to the border;      nevertheless, we could not get there directly.      For that we had to climb a hill, almost six hours to cross.      By the time we arrived at the migration office,      we learned that the line was very long.      We needed to have a lot of patience      if we wanted to get the paper      that would allow us to cross our country</p>    
    <div class="photo">     <figure>      <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-6.jpg"/>      <figcaption>       Despair was something that affected us day after day       seeing that you are on the road for months and       still cannot get to the place where you want to go.       Sometimes you do not even want to talk to your family       to tell them how the situation is, you prefer to hide the       information because of the shame you felt      </figcaption>     </figure>
         <p>We rested and watched other people who were arriving on the same road,      but they did not have the same luck as us.      They told us that thieves had come after them on the road,      taking their money and valuables.      It was understandable that they came to cry,      because what they went through was so terrible      We all knew that, at any moment the same thing could happen to us,      that is, to put it coldly,      that there could be more tears. USTIN: DON'T THINK I GOT IT RIGHT. WHAT IS THE COLD REALIZATION? MORE TEARS? NO TEARS?</p>    
         <p>Migration gave us a visa document for thirty days,      but there were so many people that day      so the government divided us up into different cities.      After a long day, without eating anything,      some of us thought we should spend the night at the border      because the transit buses were downtown,      but nobody wanted to stay with us.      Because of this, we took a taxi      to bring us to the bus terminal and      paid for a van to Medellin,      with the intention to processing the document      for crossing the country.      Then, the border officer provided us a paper      that would permit us to travel to Medellin</p>    
         <p>On the road, when we had almost arrived,      we ran into a group of soldiers,      two of them were inspecting our luggage outside and      the other two asked us if we had papers.      They did not really care about the papers.      They ordered nobody to get off the truck.      The told us to take off our shoes to verify that we were not carrying drugs and      two of the soldiers who were below took the shoes, money,      whatever they wanted      Nevertheless, we Haitians were already prepared for this, with our money hidden inside deodorants, inside soaps,      in different places throughout our belongings and our bodies.    
         <p>After taking everything that they could,      they asked us to calm down so that the trip could continue.      We saw no legal reason why they had detained us,      we only saw the injustice of their work      We had thought, innocently,      that they were there to help, but no,      theft was part of their job,      part of the illicit enrichment of the military.      During this year of migration, they were definitely doing very well.      Our courage and helplessness did not end here. (WHY COURAGE and HELPLESSNESS?)      When the van continued,      a gentleman looked inside his shoes and did not see his money.      He cried a lot, a truly exaggerated and very strong cry.      This made the others angry      We were all under pressure.</p>    
         <p>This man maintained us that his money was in his shoes      and we began to have doubts because there were so many      Colombians in the bus who told us that those policemen      were pure thieves.      We knew our rights and we should have gone      to a police station to file a complaint,      but we did not have any status in the country      and we were too afraid because      we thought they were to deport us if we went.</p>    
         <p>It came as a surprise and      a regret that we got so angry with this gentleman for crying      because when we arrived at the city and      got out of the van to open our backpacks,      we realized that, in some very skilled and perverse manner,      they had robbed many of us of money, clothes, shoes.      Immediately, those affected us began to cry      and quickly tried to make a barrier to stop      the bus, but the result was useless.</p>    
         <p>My friends and I had another way to hide the money,      so this time we were not affected as they were were      Nevertheless, I was sincerely very sad to see my      How could they continue without money?      fellow travel suffer.      Through our good or bad luck, we could continue and so we did.</p>    
         <p>At the same time, we were also annoyed with them,      because even though they knew what we would be exposed to,      to the abuse of the authorities, they not take proper precautions.      We discussed with them that it was possible to put their valuables      in their backpacks and not in their wallet,      where the police are not authorized to put their hands.      After this bad experience, we took a taxi to the migration office.      When we arrived, he had to wait a moment      for them to speak with us about the document they were going to issue.    
         <p>With all that we had lived in such a short time,      we hoped and blessed God, thanks to whom      there still exists good people      who do not mind if they are criticized or cursed      who give food to whomever needs it,      and we needed it because      we were dying of hunger and thirst.      God was showing us his care through these people      who did not know who we were nor where we came from,      who might not speak our language,      but who let themselves be guided by What      in order to give what little they had to the migrants.      With such luck we recharged the batteries      to be able to continue with what we lacked.    
         <p>Although we expected the immigration officers to see us,      they did not receive us.      The authorities told us that we had to return      very early the next day      and also offered us to stay in      the country, saying that they were going to give us many opportunities.      However, nobody wanted to remain in Columbia.      It was to early to make a decision like this.      The goal of reaching in Columbia was to have that official stamp      that would allow us to cross the country to enter Panama.      There was no time to rest.      In this way, and with a bit of encouragement, we went directly      to the bus terminal to buy a ticket      which brought us to the next city, Medellin.</p>    
         <p>While we were in the bus to go to Medellin,      we took more precautions due to our experiences on the previous trips      The bus drivers seemed to receive a commission      from the restaurants where they brought us,      because they were very expensive restaurants      and they stopped there every time.      We wanted to save our money,      so we did not enter , only bought whatever      minimal thing needed for survival.      Half of us ate, half of us drank, and half of us slept.</p>    
         <p> We reached the city of Medellin at night      and went straight to the bus terminal to leave for Turbo,      the last city before entering the terrible Darien Gap.      Turbo is one of the cities where we felt like we were in Haiti      because its population is dark-skinned      Here they did not look at us like some exotic creature or some freak.      We felt at home, because we did not look like foreigners, we were all the same      Some of the Haitians who came to this town did not stop to rest,      but instead took a boat right away to Darien Gap.      Error.      For this lack of reasoning and wisdom many wound up dead      or sick due to physical fatigue, and had to      return to their place of origin.</p>    
         <p>Everyone knows that the jungle is a dangerous, deadly place,      where you must walk a great deal and must guard yourself      against multiple dangers      However, many did not heed the warnings of our brothers      who had already crossed through there.      In order to enter the jungle, one must first rest      so that you will be at 100 percent, because the Tapon del Darien,      also known in English as the Darien Gap, is the swamp-filled jungle,      located on the edge between Central America (Panama) and South America (Columbia).      This area is still as wild as in the time of the Conquest.      Only that now it is ravaged by armed groups,      assaults are the order of the day and women are raped,      while tropical illnesses like dengue or malaria are at the door.      What this means that it is not pleasant to walk through there</p>    
         <p>If it not I am mistaken, one has to cross one hundred miles.      My group and I, using our common sense, decided to stay three days in Turbo      in order to feed ourselves well and      to regain our strength, resting so that we would be able to continue.</p>    
         <p>We were not ignorant of the place's dangers.      We knew beforehand that, if we were not aware,      would were not going to survive and as a result that we would not      be able to reach our next destination: Panama.      We heeded the advice of our friends who had already made the journey.      They explained to us that we would have to be patient about leaving.      If not, we were not going to get out of there alive,      due to the manifold threats</p>    
         <p>We followed the advice and went to look for a hotel.      We were thirteen Haitians in search of a place to rest.      Some persons opened their houses and rented us some rooms.      The people were very kind to host us because the hotels were very expensive.      Although we found some cheap ones, but they did not have a television,      and we were looking, not only to rest,      but also for some distraction.      At night, we had a meeting to plan the voyage.      We all had to share what money we had      in order to buy food, water, and personal items.</p>    
         <p>The next morning we divided up into groups,      each one of us with our own task to do.      We had to go to the market.      The day was too hot.      It was a Saturday and we felt exhausted by so much heat.      When we returned, we made a lot of food, joked around,      drank a beer and at night, we went to sleep early.      These moments were pleasant because they made us forget the suffering which we had gone through.</p>    
         <p>Sunday was a special day because we laughed as much as we could,      from the morning to night,      and so we spent the day, distracting ourselves.      Monday was the day to leave.      We went early to buy tickets and some boots,      in order to be able to cross the mud which we knew      we would have to cross, because it rains every day in the jungle.      We prepared our backpacks and necessities;      the departure time was ten in the morning,      the longboat would leave at this time and it was not going to wait for us.      This longboat was a legal form of transportation , under the control of the Navy.      It transported people to Turbo in order to buy shellfish.      We were forty persons, mostly Haitians and Cubans, in the longboat.      We all put on life jackets to prevent any possible accident.      The trip lasted two hours</p>    
         <p>There is not a living being who does not feel afraid      when confronted by danger;      courage grows from confronting it and acting brave.      In this moment, our strength was our family      and what we could offer them in the future.      That is what motivated us to continue.</p>    
         <p>We had no aim in mind other than making money      When I saw the sea and the reefs,      I thought that I was crazy,      because I was endangering my life in this voyage,      and I asked myself whether it was worth the pain      to endanger myself like this.</p>    
         <p>The sea was so rough that      even the man who thought himself strongest      broke down from the fear provoked      by sailing in these waters.      It was a terrible sensation. Your heart beat speeds up.      Your blood pressure goes up and down.      Thoughts began to play with us again.      Suddenly it came to mind that      it would be better to lay down in the river and end everything.      The truth is, if you did not control your mind      you would wind up crazy.      You needed a lot of mental strength to not go insane.      But thank God we left those stormy waters alive.</p>    
    <div class="photo">     <figure>      <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-7.jpg"/>      <figcaption>       It was a pleasure for everyone       to go see their friends who were sailing in this little boat.       Around 40 persons were in each boat.       This was the beginning of an adventure       into the great and deep Darien Gap      </figcaption>     </figure>    
         <p>We were all afraid to start this journey.      However, we had to use the fear which ran through our bodies      defensively and to continue despite everything.      This did not prevent us from      continuing to dream hopefully      about reaching our final destination,      independently of our current situation</p>

         <p>Chapter IV. Darien Gap</p>    
         <P>Save yourself, whoever can</p>    
         <p>For us, Darien Gap was the most horrible part of the game;      we tried to be cautious and to take the things calmly      if we wanted to remain alive.      We knew that we were going to walk for several days      through a very risky place.      When we reached the beach shore, we met many Colombians      who were waiting for us to      guide us on the way to Panama. My group was overloaded with several suitcases and food,      while other groups, by luck of the draw,      brought barely anything. The guide took me and my group to the front      due to all the things which we brought.</p>    
    <div class="photo">     <figure>      <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-9.jpg"/>      <figcaption>       Before taking the way through the forest,       everyone must give their paper to the officials       when they arrive       to validate their voyage into the jungle       -- the way to erase the evidence that       you are going through these places,       in case that you stay in the forest.      </figcaption>     </figure>    
    <div class="photo">     <figure>      <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-10.jpg"/>      <figcaption>       This road was filled with women from different nations.       There were also strong women, as many as the men!      </figcaption>     </figure>    
         <p>During our first hours on the road,      everyone began to converse about how to calm down, but fearfully.      There were good and bad parts of knowing about this journey from other people.      we were already in a state of anticipation      because we already know the place's dangers.      Walking was difficult because not all of us      had the physical constitution to keep up of the guides,      and at the time,      neither could we abandon those left behind.      since they were vulnerable people, such as women,      some of whom were pregnant and had kids;      The only one option was to wait for      them to line up with the group      and then to walk all together.      We crossed the first mountain in an hour and,      when we reached the peak, we saw a gorgeous landscape:      there were cows, donkeys, horses.      We asked ourselves how they could have gotten there,      thus there was no way could have gotten there themselves; (???)      there were not even houses</p>    
         <p>We could appreciate a very calm river      everything seemed to be fine.      Apparently, the guides knew to where to take us      and had everything planned      As a thing irregular and outside of all logic,      we came to rest in a place in the jungle      where there were tents, music, and beer.      It appeared like a place for a party, for it was already six in the afternoon.      We were very estranged by the panorama we saw,      but at the end of the story,      it was their business.      We tried to have fun in this place,      but unfortunately the prices of things were very inflated.      Sadly, they abused migrants:      this was the only place where one could get something to eat or drink.      A simple bottle of water could cost up to two dollars, if not more.      They mistakenly believed that we were carried rolls of bills</p>    
         <p>The group consisted of one hundred persons.      We decided to camp out for the night.      It was no five star hotel.      We were in the outdoors,      so      some women left to cut wood for cooking      and the men, enjoying the brothel that was a few steps away      to go drinking and dancing      I joined them and we went to "have fun."      Incredibly, after what we had lived through,      in the midst of this environment,      we could be distracted momentarily.      When the meal was ready,      we all sat in a circle for dinner,      Afterwards we went to sleep and allowed the night to pass.      That same night, the guides tried to prepare us psychologically,      telling us that the first days would be the most difficult.      It seemed like they were unaware that we were in contact with people who      who had already passed through this terrain.</p>    
         <p>Again we were waiting with anticipation.      It is obvious: who is not afraid of the unknown?      But at least I was not inclined to give up and go back.      Once you start a project in your life, you must use      all of your energies to finish it,      even if you do not have any.      You do it because you do it.      Only one thing can make your dream impossible: giving up</p>    
         <p>The rain started at ten at night and      we did not have any way to cover ourselves.      It was very terrible for us because we were not in a protected area.      We tried, as much as possible, to cover the children who were our priority.      We covered them with plastics, backpacks, and so on.      It was raining every day and      it was going to continue,      because that is the climate of the jungle.      Due to the rain,      the mountains became unsafe because      anyone could suffer an accident on the wet slippery ground.     </p>    
         <p>Because of the prevailing weather,      many were desperate to return,      which by then was no longer possible.      With such luck ,      they had to take strength where they could      because we were warned that once we started,      we could not return.      It is like gambling: you risk it for all or nothing      That was our reality.      With all the sorrow, the cold, the exhaustion, the wet food, the wet clothes, it was impossible not to      regret of having left our place of origin.</p>    
         <p>At five in the morning,      we prepared to continue through the Darien Gap.      The guides were grumpy, bitter, angry people;      it could even be said that they were inhuman.      They had no patience to wait for anyone,      they told us that we would start to travel at six in the morning.      They spoke with us to warn us      that we were going to cross a mountain      that would take eighth hours to cross      and that we should not even think about touching any tree or plant,      because they could be very dangerous for us, even deadly.      The plants were filled with thorns,      we could not support ourselves or rest on any of them.      The animal which we had to watch out for was the cobra, because they were abundant here.      There was no possibility of staying somewhere along the path.      WE had to travel non-stop until the end,      due to how many savage animals      we could face.      Therefore, we had to continue walking      until we reached the other side of the mountain before it grew dark.      That was the plan.    
    <div class="photo">     <figure>      <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-11.jpg"/>      <figcaption>       Often, in the afternoon, when we were tired of walking,       we rested, and the women prepared the food.      </figcaption>     </figure>    
         <p>Due to the rain of the night before,      our bodies were wet, tired and sleepless.      We did not know how      we were going to be able to continue like this.      Nevertheless, we prepared to leave and as soon as we could,      we prayed or invoked, (REZAR / ORAR)      in all different ways      according to our faiths.      Our trust was in God because he could sustain us on the road.</p>    
         <p>I just observed people      and realized that many were traveling alone,      without friends or family members.      Although there were times in which one --      according to his interests, even if he did not want to --      thought selfishly about continuing without going back.      I am not going to say there were not moments      during which we all needed each other,      and it was clear that we would help each other      and we felt that it was out of the place      to try to ignore totally the situation of the other.</p>    
    <p>AWK ABOVE!!!    </p>         <p>After five hours of travel,      we asked the guides to allow us to rest;      the children were already exhausted      and our pace was sluggish      because the ground was wet      and that made it more difficult.      We were able to rest for only fifteen minutes,      because we only had eight hours to cross.      The mountain was the border of Columbia,      the jungle was located between Colombia and Panama      and that day's objective was to complete      the mountain crossing and to reach the border of Panama.     </p>    
         <p>After those Five hours of travel,      we realized that we were not the only ones on the road.      It touched me to see the people crying desperately,      asking themselves how they are going to continue --      people who already gotten further ahead.      The mountain was very steep,      it was impossible to see the peak.      My friend and I rested between fifteen and thirty minutes.      We were confident that we could reach it, because      compared to the women and the children,      we were in better shape.      them, thus buying us with the women and the children, we would have a better condition</p>    
    <div class="photo">     <figure>      <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-12.jpg"/>      <figcaption>       The men took the responsibilities       for carrying all the suitcases       so that the children and the women would be       free as the air,       with the goal that they would not delay the group      </figcaption>     </figure>    
         <p>On this mountain we saw death, impatience, desperation, agony.      However, it strengthened the faith of believers.      During this journey the strongest men helped the women,      the children and the men who were vulnerable      That day more than one hundred people crossed by the mountain range.</p>    
         <p>Emotions and heart palpitations were very strong      due to all the pressure and the stress.      At that time, we were close to the peak,      but at the same time, the traffickers informed us that      we were still six hours away.      We did not have the option of camping in the jungle,      so they asked us to hurry up our walking or running.      Without wasting time, my group and I followed the directions as well as we could.      It was just at that moment that I felt the most defenseless, fragile,      lost in cruel and very unstable thoughts that came and went      For good reason, you worry that you might      never see your family or your friends again.      Inside myself, I battled with my own demons.      I told myself that at any moment      a wild animal would jump on top of us,      because each howl sounded nearby      and at the same time very far away.      I did not know if you have ever been to the jungle,      but it was hard to hear those roars and      to think that everything would be fine.</p>    
         <p>The sounds were varied, of all types of animals,      so many that we could not identify them      The sounds were so very loud that I guessed      they were lions, tigers, jaguars, spider monkeys, pumas,      or, well, the triumphal entrance of a cobra.</p>    
    <div class="photo">     <figure>      <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-13.jpg"/>      <figcaption>       The lower part is a mountain range       that took us six hours to climb      </figcaption>     </figure>    
         <p>Here is just when you pause      and you start thinking about the importance      of the things that you posses.      In this instant we were all carrying money,      but we could understand that it would have no value there.      We had moved from our apparent stability --      in my case, from Brazil, where I thought a lot about      blessed money,      giving it significant value,      and now money was not worst anything.      What good was it to have money and to not use it?      What good was it if you could die?      The Bible says that the root of all evil is the love of money.      Well in my case it was.      I traveled the world looking for dollars      and just for dollars I could die.      How ironic and cruel.</p>    
         <p>There is a character named Don Ramon,      from the famous Mexican television series "El Chavo Del Ocho"      (The 8 Year Old Kid)      who said very assertively      "I might not have a single peso in my bag      but I have a smile on my face,      which is worth more than all the money in the world."      How I longed to have a smile that is worth gold      How difficult it is to give things their true value and      to learn to value them differently      based on your experience      This could be an advantage, depending on how you see it.</p>    
         <p> We were going as fast as we could      With my feet exhausted and powerless      due to such a tortuous road,      I carried my bag on my shoulders,      thinking only about how this would all end.      By the time we reached the foot of mountain top      seven hours had already passed.      It was the Panamanian part of the Darien Gap.      After thirty minutes of walking on the foot of mountain,      we began to hear many more noises.      We thought that, fortunately,      they were Panamanians,      but no, they were also migrants like us,      Cubans, who informed us that      we were about to arrive at a shelter, the first in Panama.</p>    
         <p>When we arrived at the shelter was in bad condition:      the earth was damp and covered with a lot of stones.</p>    
         <p>There we met the people from Ghana and other parts of Africa,      Cuba, Pakistan, Brazil, Haiti, and many other countries.     <p>Before entering we were asked us to make      a line to get a number,      which would as our registration and our exit pass.      There were many people ahead of us.      This wore down our patience,      even though we honestly did not have any.      I got the number 328.      It was terrible to have to wait so long.      They called 50, 80, or 100 persons a day, but not every day.      The situation was very depressing and hopeless.      Because we did not have freedom of movement,      everything we thought about doing      we had to inform the soldiers, who were      the ones who decided how best to manage the place      That is, strict and rigorous control was evident.    
         <p>After they gave me my number,      I took time to reflect upon the people who stayed behind.      It was not possible for us, as much as we tried, to all come together.      I was worried about a friend from Brazil who came with me.      He made the decision to stay with two women      who were brought a girl.      It was a very altruistic act, disinterested on his part,      for which I admire and respect him.</p>    
         <p>At around eight in the evening we began to see people arriving at the shelter.      It made me so happy to see my friend come in.      Although it broke my heart to see him arrive in tears      along the other people because they      could not believe that they had made it.      Who would not feel terrified of staying alone in the jungle, without protection.      It makes sense that you would get emotionally overwhelmed      with joyfulness and gratefulness for getting out alive.     </p> 
         <p>The soldiers were in charge of giving us rice and oil      so that we ourselves could make our food,      because we had left in the road the food that we had brought.      This was not so disagreeable; it was not a normal meal,      but it was enough to alleviate the hunger.</p>    
    <div class="photo">     <figure>      <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-14.jpg"/>      <figcaption>       The first shelter in Panama.       This place was fit for pigs      </figcaption>     </figure>    
   
       <p>Those moments were irritating, annoying,     because there was no place to sleep.     You yourself had to come and make your tent on the     damp group and on the rocks     It was atrocious.     Because not only was the weather cold,     you could not hide yourself from the rain.     The suffering continued.     When everyone was looking for a place to set up camp,     the soldiers began to shoot bullets in the air     so that the wild animals would not approach us.     , the purpose being to scare them away.     The climate of the jungle is tropical –- rainy;     As soon as evening approaches, the rain comes.     This is why nobody is able to sleep,     because the tends we made for shelter     were made of cloth or calico (MANTA)     and functioned only to cover us from the sun.</p>   
       <p>Obviously the children began to cry     but this was the least of our problems;     the real problem was that some     savage beast could devour us.     Therefore, in this situation,     we had to put our trust in the soldiers     who were stayed to guard.     The night seemed endless.</p>   
       <p>We assumed that, sadly,     there were still persons who had remained in the jungle.     Wherever they were,     their situation was unpleasant.     I could not imagine how they were doing.     In the morning we began to see some of them arriving.     They came with many injuries to their heads, torsos,     hands and legs.     Despite this, they were happy to     find a place where they could, apparently, rest.     We only helped them out with setting up their tents,     but they were extremely exhausted.</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/unknown.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      When we came to this site,      we had to get something to eat before it started raining.      That was the situation.      </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>In the morning, the only thing we were waiting for     was for them to start calling the numbers that could     leave that day, which made us impatient.     As I already knew that     my number was going to take a while to be called,     I stayed with my friends, chatting,     watching the exit route beforehand     and not waiting for our turn.     We observed and observed and observed.     As a first option,     many Haitians began to offer things of value to the soldiers;     everything they could:     tennis shoes, shirts, bracelets, necklaces, rings and money,     anything that might allow them to leave,     even at nighttime</p>   
       <p>My friends and I were smarter.     We looked for a pen and paper of the same color     with which they wrote the numbers.     We made twenty numbers and we tried to use them.     We did a first trial run,     writing out five numbers for five friends,     with the result that they got called and exited that day.     Thanks God the soldiers called one hundred person persons     that day     and those five numbers entered.     Thus we confidently declared: we will leave tomorrow!</p>   
       <p>The day was very slow, very heavy, very tough.     As you can imagine the ground was not comfortable at all.</p>   
       <p>At night, a Haitian invited me to go me with him.     because he had very daringly paid a soldier     to let him go beforehand.     It was a tempting offer.     However, thinking carefully about it,     I told him no,     that I would rather wait for the number that     I myself had made     Everyone knows that traveling at night     is extremely dangerous, completely unsafe,     due to the kinds of animals that one could encounter.     Yet he did go.     This was an example of why we should not give into our impatience,     because this was a very bad decision.</p>   
       <p>At the same time,     I saw a group of Haitians who were yelling very loudly,     who shouted that there was a lion.     That was when we all started to run.     No matter if you had a children or wife by your side,     what mattered was saving oneself.     Women left their children behind and     husbands left their wives behind     in order to save their own lives.     Everyone started running, screaming, crying out to God or     to whomever they believed in.     The soldiers began shoot bullets into the air in order     to frighten the lion.</p>   
       <p>After this scare,     I saw a friend who had fallen and     hurt himself on the way.     Suddenly, blood began to flow from his mouth     Along with him was an 8-month pregnant woman     who was also injured.     They were not the only ones.     Many people got hurt and needed medical attention.     Luckily, they were transferred to another shelter     which had helicopters that brought them to the     city to be taken care of</p>   
       <p>Those nights were very long and     you spent them without sleeping,     just thinking that something might happen.     It was best to keep your eyes wide open, for anything.</p>   
       <p>On was the second night, early, after eating something,     the soldiers began to call the numbers.     This day they had a list of 120.     Thank God, my friends and I passed     with the numbers that we had made.     We were happy for our great accomplishment     and because we were not discovered.</p>    We needed to walk 45 minutes to reach another shelter.    The soldiers told us to walk at the same pace as the slow people    so that we could all reach the second jungle shelter together    without any problems   
       <p>We 120 people began to hike to this place,     better than the previous one,     due to the ground was in better shape,     at least water wasn't pouring all over where we were staying.     Our journey was relatively quick.     We thought that were going to see houses, cars,     other people around here, but no we didn't.     Our patience became exhausted and     we thought that we had arrived at a community,     but nothing could be more wrong;     this period was much longer than we thought.    </p>    (I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS PARAGRAPH)   
       <p>When we arrived at this shelter,     they organized us into groups of four     to put up tents where we would stay while we were there.     We made the tents with tree leaves,     which would only serve to cover us from the sun     As we arrived early,     they gave us time to cook;     it was the same: rice with oil, river water and salt.</p>   
       <p>The numbering system was the same as before,     but with a little bit of skill and cleverness     we would be able to leave early.     We knew beforehand that, if we could not forge numbers,     then we could bribe some soldier discretely.     By the same token, that night     they called some of us to continue on the way,     because we had paid them for the favor.     Payment was not necessarily money, but anything of value,     as I have already explained.     You could give fifteen dollars or you could give your sneakers,     your dress shoes, or whatever else you could.     Unfortunately it was not possible to forge numbers in this place     because they were not written with a pen on paper,     but instead with a marker on a carton.   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-15.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      This was often our food:      a mix of rice with noodles, salt, and water     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>This location could count on a helicopter     to transfer sick people or pregnant women     or women with children, in case it was necessary.     On any given day, there could be two departures or sometimes none     like on the weekends, when there were no flights.     Here the waiting time was uncertain,     we had no choice but to try to arm ourselves with a lot of patience     because the waiting times could be long.</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-16.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      They let us sleep in the forest      without any type of hope      We had no right to make a decision.      Our words had no value.      We were punished very often.     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>Unfortunately, because we were men we were not allowed     to travel in the helicopter,     due to the prevailing idea of masculinity,     a mistaken one,     as a strong and enduring (stable? -- i think it has to do with medical, so find a different word),     but under these circumstances both sexes     underwent the same deprivation, the same needs,     the same adversities,     and we all found that it was enough to make you cry.     Crying allowed us to express our pain.     We also grew tired, we also got weaker,     we also broke down.     Under so much pressure there was     no manliness to take care of. (???)     What we felt we expressed through tears.     However, I imagine that,     if any of us were in a grave state, (had a serious condition? no because also injuries? WEAK)     they would indeed use the helicopter for     humanitarian reasons</p>   
       <p>We continued walking and     they told us that the quickest way to leave     was to construct an improvised boat,     which they -- the soldiers -- would put to sea.     With force or without, with hunger or with thirst;     they indicated who was going to build it     I supposed let themselves get carried away with what they saw in us.   
   <P>(CONFUSING LAST SENTENCE)</P>       <p>Right away my friends and I hatched a plan.     We began to investigate who among us had markers     and who could acquire a carton,     thus that we could go back to forging the numbers     so that we could leave before the group     that we came with     We did all this in secret, very privately, because,     if we didn't, the others would ask us for a number     and we would be found out.</p>   
       <p>That afternoon the soldiers organized a swimming competition.     People of all nations entered the competition:     Cubans, Nepalese, Haitians, Africans, etc.     Whoever knew how to swim could defend their country.     This game was an very ingenious and recreational activity(AWK)     that made us forget momentarily where were.     For those instants, we thought that we were real a community,     in the midst of a reality that wasn't ours.</p>   
       <p>The Panamanian soldiers won the competition,     with their physical condition and their adaptation to the environment.     Also they were not as tired as us.     These moments of distraction were very satisfying</p>   
       <p>This night it rained very hard,     We thought that the soldiers would stay with us to guard us     but it wasn't so: they left the place     There was not as much danger as in the previous shelter.     A group was escaped in secret because     they felt like they were free     There were no soldiers around so     they took to the road.     However, one of them was in for a surprise     While a soldier was doing his business     a considerable distance away,     he encountered the Haitian and beat him brutally.     Very savagely, he handcuffed him and put his head in a bucket of water     In addition the brutal beating, they tied him to the tree     so that we could see him there the next day.</p>   
       <p>This made us all very angry and we began to fight and argue.     Our defense was that we were not slaves or prisoners     who deserved to be treated this way.     After this we warned them that if they did not let us cross     we would go by ourselves, and that, because they did not     appear to have the power to shoot us,     we were not going to stop.     Therefore, the soldiers considered our words     because we outnumbered there them and     very intelligently, to calm us down,     they began to call over one hundred person every two days.</p>   
       <p>As I have mentioned before,     we were from different countries and     each group looked after its own well being and     sought its own ways to cross before their turn.     We learned that the Cubans and the Nepalese were organizing     to escape in boats that had been built     in agreement with the soldiers     Thus, we watched all night to make sure this would not happen     and to stop them if they thought of getting away.</p> (WHY WOULD YOU CARE IF THEY SNUCK OUT?)   
       <p>In the other place that awaited was that the one was authorized     the number of people who could cross.     It was supposed to be one hundred, but the soldiers announced only eighty     so that they could sell the other twenty.     The Haitians were very aware of the situation and,     despite the tricks which we played to advance our own destiny,     in this case we asked that the exits be fair.    </p>   
       <p>The plan which the soldiers were executing was a failure     because it did not work out as they thought.     Among the hundred who asked were more Haitians than Cubans or Nepalese     They outnumbered them     They did not allow the hundred people to pass,     only the hundred people who built the boats were allowed to cross,     which was around eighty     Nevertheless, we took the opportunity to cross with them.</p>   
       <p>They left us in the rafts and     the only thing we knew was that we should follow the river.     Here it was impossible to ask someone for information     because no one could answer.     The indication was to continue; the only thing that we had     to guide us was our instincts,     to continue until we reached solid earth     and to look for where we midget find an indigenous tribe.     Before leaving, the soldiers gave us some recommendations;     they told us that we should follow the river until we got     to a stop and that we should wait there for one or two days.     Since we no longer had food, they took care of giving us     energetic drinks and cookies.</p>   
       <p>Everybody was happy to leave,     but we did not know what we were going to face     In our group there were many children,     and we thought selfishly of leaving beforehand and moving quickly,     but we did not do it because we knew that     these women and their children needed our help.</p>   
       <p>During this journey,     I observed people's faces, faces that reflected     sadness, despair, depression, fear, insecurity, uncertainty;     it was very disturbing to see that panorama.     At dawn, we decided to leave at eight in the morning.     It was a sunny day, but because there was so much foliage,     it seemed to better to do so at night.     It was not a river that flowed calmly,     it was much more turbulent that which we could possibly imagine     The current was so strong.</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-17.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      A rest in groups, independently of the company.      The Nepalese were more afraid than the others;      despite this, they were fraternizing with the different peoples     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>There was a funereal silence.     Whatever sound was very noticeable and disturbing.     Each one of us was lost in their own thoughts,     maybe some cried out to god,     others thought of their families or     if they would get out alive     of these apparently endless waters.     It was not possible to estimate how much time     we would spend on the river     or whether we could emerge unscathed.     We were very surprised and encouraged     able to see that people who had passed here before     had taken the time to make marks on the path.     On some branches hung clothing or sticks were outfitted with clothing     to tell us which way to go.     This brought our souls back to our the bodies.</p>   
       <p>The river was endless, and     because there were many children with us,     we stopped at two in the afternoon and decided     to take a short rest at the foot of the mountain,     to be able to continue our voyage afterwards     We arrive on the other side around five in the afternoon.     FORGOT TO DO THIRD DRAFT HERE ALERT MITCHELL     Fortunately, some women brought some food with them     and started to recollect that there have been that     which in times primitives, when all share the alimentation.     Here we were as we could eat all the afternoon</p>   
       <p>We decided to rest and sleep there.     Suddenly we began to perceive a fetid odor, we did not know from where.     Two two minutes from the mountain     stood a hut that had been built -- I imagine -- by some group     that had crossed before.     It didn't matter, we did not get close to it.     It was about ten in the evening;     some of us decided to sleep on the riverbank and     others a bit further away,     but suddenly a storm came and     none of us moved from where we were,     because there was no way to avoid being drenched with water.     We began to hear the river get louder     than we had heard before on this journey and     we realized that the water level was rising     This is when the women with their children     began to run rapidly     because we did not know     whether the water level was going to rise or     how far it might ascend.     Seeing women trying to climb the mountain to protect their children     was a desperate scene,     but they could not walk because the mud did not allow them to     and when they tried to they fell to the ground with their kids.     I will never forget those faces of terror, fear, and frustration.     Everyone began to cry out to God with desperate screams,     crying just like the children did     It hurt to see them so defenseless,     without being able to express what they really felt.     You could not tell them that nothing was going to happen     because they were seeing all of it.     These are the sorts of things which,     although they might be forgotten overtime,     will still arise inside as inexplicable terrors.    </p>   
       <p>We remembered that the soldiers had told us     that our destination was a day or a day and a half away,     and we had traveled barely a day.     So we tried to calm ourselves down, relax     and to breathe with the hope that     we would be able to rest in another half day.     However, with the storm and the rising of the river     came the doubt as to whether this half day would become     a full day more.     The storm stopped around one in the morning;     the men were protecting and watching the river go down.     Around three in the morning, the water level went down,     although not to the level it had been before.     We noticed that the the river was flowing with a lot of dirty water,     preventing us from knowing its depth or where we could safely step.</p>   
       <p>The women who had climbed the mountain     to protect themselves from the river descended     to sleep on the shore once the water level had subsided.     At four, we went to sleep.     At six we began to prepare to cross it     and to start our way towards our new unknown destination.     We did not have food or drinking water,     nor any way to feed the children.     We began to wonder how we were going to make it across.     We were very afraid.     The water was filthy and very cold,     but there was hardly any other recourse:     our only option was to cross the river and to drink from it.</p>   
       <p>The worst part was that most of us did not know how to swim.    <p> Only two men knew, but they were not willing to risk their lives.     Under these circumstances,     we made the decision to put a foot in the water to know     how far I could reach and how deep the water was.     I do not know how to swim,     but I knew that I wouldn't drown in the water     because I had learned how to float, so I floated on the river     The water was completely freezing     It occurred to someone to say that     we were looking for a place were the current was faster     because we discovered that the calmer waters were more dangerous.     SO we walked in search of a place where the river ran quickly     and we all held hands and began to cross linked together.     There were rocks here, so we didn't go down (???)     the water reached our waistline and we were able to make it.    </p>   
       <p>Hope was leaving us and returning to us.     During this leg of the journey     we did not see a single signpost,     nor a hanging towel, nor clothes, nothing     Despair newly arose in our minds.     Truly you had to have a lot of self-control to not go crazy.     Your mind had to be very strong to resist.     We walked about two hours along the river holding hands     only to realize that the road we had taken was not the right one     so we had to go back and look for another.     In this setting things became complicated,     because it was a very narrow road     and we had to step slowly.     There was no way to link us together,     therefore we used our hands     to hold onto the tree limbs     and we could cross     We took slow steps,     being careful that our feet did get stuck in the river,     because the bed was not stable.     There was the change that we would remained trapped there.    </p>   
       <p>We looked after the women and the children.     There was a moment when tallest people     had to have the courage to cross.     Of course, he was taller than me.     When the tallest man crossed, the water came up to his neck.     People of average height were worried     that they would be drowned in the river.    </p>   
       <p>We managed to tie tree branches to our arms     then to link everybody with them so as not to lose anybody.     This was the way that we were able to cross.     Fortunately everyone lived.     In the distance we saw a towel hanging on a branch,     so we could breathe the air of hope anew</p>   
       <p>About three hundred meters away     I saw a group of people and I began yelling to them and yelling and them,     but they did not hear me.     Then, I turned to advise the others,     telling them about the people outside;     probably we would find food there.     Then we quickened our pace to get there.     Over there was a a tent where a guide lived,     and people sitting and resting.     When we arrived we asked the person responsible     if he would give us permission     to stay there and rest.     He said that he was waiting for other people     to make a trip     since he made only one departure per day     I talked with some people and they informed us     that they were awaiting a guide who had gone     to look for food for them</p>   
       <p>When the guide arrive, he said that     the path ahead     was even more risky and that     there was no way to cross the mountain,     so we would have to go down a river     It cost five dollars per person.     We waited a bit longer to see     if more people would arrive,     but we were starting to lose our patience,     so we asked whether we could please continue.     We agreed to leave after eating     the plantains     they had brought, which we cooked in salt water.</p>   
       <p>At first it was only a supervisor     who went with us,     but after thirty minutes we met another.     The latter stayed behind the people and     the other in front     with the intention of monitoring that all     continued at the same pace.     This tremendous character charged ten dollars     to carry people's backpacks.     He said to us that we would walk three hours     to reach a river with four points.     A very long stream -- he said -- very, very long.     You had to go very slowly to cross it     and it took about seven minutes to traverse it.     This is what     one of the two guides     warned us about     at the beginning of the journey.     We reached a point where , to cross the stream,     we had to form a line.     Ties passed through our bodies     so that we would keep an eye out     for anyone who stumbled,     because the creek had many stones.     It was very risky</p>   
       <p>You could not hurry,     you had to make the crossing very deliberately.     The personalities (AWK -- sujetos) that guided us     helped us to cross     only because they did not want to stay in the line,     and they, like us, did not know the risks involved.     They were afraid of dying because the creek was very deep.     We made it.     Once it was over, we rested about five minutes.     The guide explained that     we were still two hours away     from reaching a town of about forty inhabitants.</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-18.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      Despite all the difficulties encountered,      we enjoyed the mountains,      we joked, we laughed, we asked ridiculous questions.      All this was a part of the unforgettable environment     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>That river was an incredible experience.     The current where we crossed was not too strong,     it looked tranquil, the rapids were not rough.     We crossed successfully, thank God.     When we arrived, although we were exhausted,     people wanted to quicken the pace     because the supervisor of the journey said     that we were still, according to him, about two hours away.     Soon a friend and I took time     to cook noodles that we had.     We made a fire and put in only salt.     We ate the noodles and continued.</p>   
       <p>In the distance, we saw that     some people     who had been behind us     were arriving,     so then we teamed up with them.     Later, we saw the people     who had been with me at the start     and we teamed up with them too.     We encountered with a three point river (WHAT IS A POINT?)     and almost none of these streams could be crossed.     The interesting thing was the water was too calm,     more than in the previous one.     These rivers ran deep.     they are said to be more dangerous     when they were calm.     The man who knew how to swim went to     inspect the river and when he returned he said it was very deep.     Due to this, we began to look for a new strategy,     because it was not possible for everyone to cross.     A line was made.     During these moments, I started to lose my patience,     therefore, a friend and I left the group.     When we left them and they started crossing,     we realized that four other Haitians had also left the group, but by accident.     I remembered well seeing a man swimming hurriedly,     trying to rescue from the waters a baby and two women.     Fortunately he was able to rescue them, but it was not possible     to rescue at everyone he saw in danger.     Far away I saw another woman who had walked away     the group for the same reasons of impatience     and the current took her away.     Luckily she was able to get afloat and     when she did she started to cry and to laugh at the same time,     it was very odd spectacle for us to witness .     Surely she cried and laughed with joy because she did not drown.     Although it might have been her nerves,     given what she had experienced in those moments.</p>   
       <p>When we reached land, we realized that     there were no more mountains or hills to cross,     only solid and flat ground     We began to walk and we sensed an strange odor,     it was again a fetid odor similar to the smell of a decomposing body     We smelled death.     Some of us went to inspect to find out whether we were right.     Unfortunately we were right: we found a dead Cuban.     I remembered him when I saw him     Once I got to speak with him and his girlfriend.     She also died; both drowned.     Many passed away in the this river,     everyone who traveled through here drinking the water     out of necessity.     Further ahead we encountered one of the Nepalese.     He died tragically     died tragically; he remained prostrate upon a rock,     giving the impression that he had     done something to kill himself.     Seeing such a dramatic and depressing panorama,     we thought that that no longer had the strength to continue     and that they were waiting for us if we also lost hope     We cried for a long time at this unfortunate event.</p>   
       <p>We caught onto the fact that the guides had lied to us     when they told us that after two hours     we would not have to not going to walk any more.     It was around six in the afternoon and still we continued walking.     The group stayed behind us.     My friend and I already no longer wanted to remain     in the jungle any longer     we reached a point where we again     saw another mountain and     we said we would cross that way,     but we were no longer willing to cross through the river     because of the dangers involved.     We had seen many deaths on the journey and we were     -- for the moment -- disposed to climb another mountain     if necessary.</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-19.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      Our food was always the same. It was like this for about twelve days,      </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>After two hours we found other guys on the mountain;     they looked very strong to continue, but not me.     We arrived in a place where you could talk and     nobody could hear you.     The sounds of the animals could be heard very clearly:     we listened to the macaques, they were very large.     The place was so beautiful that     it gave the impression that you were close to God</p>   
       <p>The reality dawned upon us as we saw how high     the mountain was     we said that if we continued walking without water     we were going to die     No option remained other for us than to return,     the men who we met did  not want to ,     but we went back.     Desperation is not a good counselor,     when you feel desperate,     you do not analyze things well     and you make bad decisions     We could have died from such foolishness     We did not see those men again.     One can imagine that they died on the way     because they could not have survived without water</p>   
       <p>With the little strength that we still had we returned,     which is why it was eleven at night when we arrived below.     My feet were so swollen, battered and tired that I took off my shoes ,     it was something I should not have done     because afterwards I could not put them on again,     but I did it     because the muscular pain I was in was barely tolerable.</p>   
       <p>Fortunately my friend brought some cookies, salt and sugar.     So we put the water from the creek in a bottle     and added salt and sugar to make a serum.     We drank it and ate the cookies     and made a fire to scare away the animals.</p>   
       <p>There were some people sleeping where we were there.     In the morning we spoke with them and     they told us that there was no choice besides     going through the river     because we would have died if we went over the mountain.     We got up and got managed to leave.     We started walked,     I had to do it without shoes because of my swollen feet</p>   
       <p>By misadventure (AWK?), by now     we were not all together,     there were people still behind us and     they had not yet caught up to us.</p>   
       <p>The plan was to leave the jungle     as soon as possible.     We began our route at five in the morning     and at ten in the morning we ran into a dead man,     whom we had seen before entering the jungle.     I remember perfectly that this Haitian     did not want to wait for his number     when we were with the soldiers;     that is to say, he probably believed he could do it alone.     Nothing could be more wrong.     A human being always is always concerned with other human beings.     To feel competent in a place you don't know is like     wanting to swim with sharks.</p>   
       <p>He had run away     And I think he died of hunger,     but he gave the impression that only     sat down to wait for  death.     How much could have passed through his mind?     This man must have suffered much.     I am sure that he took time to speak to God and     settle accounts with Him.     It seemed this way because he     had all of his clothes on and     he did not look injured.     We started to look for money inside his clothes     and found 400 dollars.     I was sad to see how his life ended     because of his despair and lack of patience     “Despair is the least of our errors” Said the Count of Lautréamont. ( _Maldoror_ by Comte de Lautréamont, trans. Guy Wernham. New York: New Directions, 339)     Definitely we have all passed through these processes, (FIND BETTER WORD FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS -- gone through these feelings)     and none successfully.    </p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-20.jpg"/>     <figcaption>       After we left this place, we still had to continue on.      We had been in the home of beasts (AWK) for about three days     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>However, grounded in the cruel reality,     this man was not going to do anything with that money.     I took a part and another Haitian the other;     we determined (AWK) to use it when necessary.     Another friend took his sneakers.     After this bitter drink we continued the journey     Ahead we saw a girl who was crying alone.     It was the girl who the river had taken,     who had that strange reaction of crying and laughing at the same time,     She said desperately that she was very hungry,     we did not know how she got so far ahead.     We walked for about ten minutes more and     started to see banana trees and horse poop,     which made us think that we were getting close.</p>   
       <p>The bananas had fallen and     with the hunger we felt     it was manna from heaven for us.     Even with our desperation to eat,     we took time to pray first,     because for us this was a true blessing.     We made a fire,     put the bananas to cook in the pot and ate them with salt.     We returned to drink water from the river in which our relatives died.</p>   
       <p>We thought that if God would not allow     the water to hurt us,     he would not abandon us on  this occasion.     When we finished eating,     we left the banana peels lying on the road     to serve as a guide     for  those who came after us.</p>   
       <p>After thirty minutes we met a gentleman with a horse     and we asked him how much time     it would take to reach the mainland     and he said one hour.     But in order to finally arrive     we had to pay to cross the road on horseback.     This was his way of earning money.     As he knew that more than one of us was     getting tired, shoeless and physically worn out,     well, this was his way of life.     I was one of those who was physically weak,     i did not know if more or less than the others,     but I had the advantage of having a way to pay.     I paid twenty dollars he charged me for him to carry me and I carried my friend with me.</p>   
       <p>The rest of the group asked:     And us? Hoe we going to go?     And I told them that they would walk.     The group did not want to remain alone     after they saw the gentleman.     Thus they walked with the pace of the horse -- almost running --     with the little force that remained in them.</p>   
       <p>Another horse arrived with a lady .     She was a woman who was standing in the road with     a very injured foot, as if she had fallen from a  mountain.     She could not walk.     So some friends paid for a horse so that she could travel.     After that they took us, they would come back for her.     Thank God she did not die on the road     in the half a day for the horse to return to her find her (AWK     When he arrived, the soldiers gave him a space so that     he could heal and bathe himself</p>

       <p>Chapter 5. Panama</p>   
       <p>Injustice, Abuse, Racism</p>   
       <p>When we were there     each one of us had a little story to tell:     there were some who     lost friends in the forests;     some who were seriously injured,     even those who came without their children     and others who came suffering with them.     The question was behind every face,     behind every fake smile,     of every look lost,     behind every tired body,     a sad story precedes us. (PRECEDES IS AWK) </p>   
       <p>The villages were considered refuges for migrants.     It was a fact that there,     whatever the conditions were for sleeping,     you still had to buy food and     rent a stove to eat.     There is a saying:     "A glass of water     is not denied to anyone"     but under these circumstances     this did not apply;     we had to buy drinking water.     This was definitely an abuse,     but we were not in a position to make demands.     We were traveling and     this was not what truly mattered to us,     as for the rest,     we knew that we     had God's protection in those places.</p>   
       <p>     Knowing the system already,     we were all assigned a number;     each day they wrote it on     different colored paper and handed them out.     Every group knew from before     that there would be a waiting time and     if you were not willing to wait,     well, you could look for another way     to pay secretly to be able to leave in a raft,     at your own risk.</p>   
       <p>Fortunately in that refuge     I began to meet my first friends,     since already were about to leave     I met them too late -- one could say --     because they left early     and it left me feeling alone.     It was a feeling that does not leave you.     Loneliness is part of being a migrant,     associated with sadness or depression.     It can be good in some ways and in others not.     Because I experienced that     solitude I became strong.     It comforted me.     Thanks to it I was more attentive to the details,     I began to know my strengths and my weaknesses.     This is how I learned things about myself     that I did not know and     did things in certain moments     that I never thought I would have,     call it good or bad.     I want to say that solitude     must also be valued.     Sometimes it's usually necessary,     especially when you learn of it.</p>   
       <p>In the evening everyone was trying to contact their families.     Not all of us had this opportunity     to dialogue with our own,     as only some could those who take advantage of     the weak signal in that area.     It was incredible that,     even for our desire to hear our parents, children, or friends,     the soldiers made us pay!     Human avarice has no limits or heart.     Everything depended on money.     Here money was everything and nothing, see?</p>   
       <p>Alexander Dumas (fils) said “Do not value money for any more nor any less than its worth; it is a good servant but a bad master.”    </p>   
       <p>Our lives did not matter to the soldiers     they got what they wanted and that was it.     Money could not bring us doctors.     Unfortunately almost all the children were sick     and needed attention;     it made sense that the parents got angry     and made some demands for respect.     However, we had to start taking care of ourselves ,     because the soldiers, ready, (LISTO? READY?)     wanted to have sex with the Haitian women.     Here you pay however you can and     it is not acceptable to judge what other people were doing.     But yes, some of them had sex     so that they were allowed to pass quickly.     Obviously we all     wanted to go and get out of there     as soon as possible,     believing falsely that it would be better in the next camp.     We also innocently believed that in the other place,     they would take less money from us.     It was impossible to think     that we could make our budget.     It was so far from reality,     The best thing to do, for now, was     to leave this place and to try to forget those episodes    </p>   
       <p>It was absurd to even consider staying here,     because clearly we would not reach our goal.     The soldiers erroneously believed     -- or at least they showed through their actions --     that we were in this chaotic situation because we liked it,     and that we spent our money     that we were paid     as if it were a summer cross vacation,     something very far from our reality.</p>   
       <p>In Panama, every small mistake counted,     each error committed marked us in a brutal manner     and threatened to make us return to the jungle.     However, we stayed calm and     burst into tears,     so we were not in any condition     to expend our energies fighting with them     or dying of courage.     The best thing to do was to focus on     what awaited us ins the jungle.     We had to avoid problems.     Haitians are violent, foolish, and stubborn;     with very great difficulty do we keep our mouths shut.     Here, in this environment, we had to learn to maintain silence.     They had weapons, us no.     They were in charge, us no.     But there were some who     could not control itself themselves     when the disrespect surpassed certain limits.     They were those who were not interested     in keeping calm for their physical and mental well being     and who did not want to obey the soldiers' orders,     escaped during the night without fearing anything.</p>   
       <p> Luckily, I did not have any altercation;     the only I desired was to avoid     whatever type of injury or unnecessary suffering.     It was better for me     to control my character and     to be wise than to suffer whatever consequences     they might mete out,     Sometimes, pride can be good,     but in was not wise to use it against oneself.     The majority of times, human beings act out of impulse,     they do not think things through, nor analyze,     nor reflect, nor meditate,     and this is how they get into trouble.     To think and to think well is very valuable     To know that to say and how to act are decisive.     You have to make them think that you are afraid of them,     give them a false respect     It is fundamental for survival with this kind of person.     They made us feel like slaves,     they gave us orders we could not ignore.     Self-control was the key in order to continue advancing.     On occasion, you have to make another person     think that they were doing a favor     and make them seem smart,     even though the intelligent one was you.</p>   
       <p>You have to convince with your attitude     that you merit respect and that are in control     That is the daily game.</p>   
       <p>Despite all this, nobody knew that the majority     of us were Haitians.     Haitian nationality was unacceptable;     if they discovered a Haitian passport, you would be deported.     In order to avoid this,     everyone said they came from of Brazzaville, Congo. </p>   
       <p> I spent four days In this terrible place without talking,     only observing and swallowing my suffering.     The day that I left here I finally would be able to smile.     But not everything ended here     the worst was yet to come     because in the next town everything would be even worse.     Because of this this, we tried to have an agreeable time.     With respect to me,     I was not going to allow these problems to impede me.     Supposedly anyone who wanted to could go,     but nobody was crazy enough to venture out by himself,     because we knew that there were traps in the forest.     The soldiers set up camp in a dirty, mosquito-ridden place,     with the aim of preventing people from leaving     They were evil!     How is it possible that a human being     could make fun of the tragedy of     another human being's tragedy, who is equal to him?     They enjoyed their evilness.     In spite of the fact that we were dejected,     we tried to improve the environment,     playing soccer and basketball,     some of us drank alcohol even though it was prohibited.     Days passed, but everything was the same,     with the same modern slavery, without rights.     We could not stay shut up     If we asked for or suggested something, they would oppose us.</p>   
       <p>One of these days of waiting,     I went to see if there was any good news for us     I examined the persons who were at my range     and noted their happiness.     The soldiers said that there were two hundred     could leave this day.     It made me happy because     I was part of this group,     so I started to get my things in order,     with the result that this was a bad joke.     They did and said whatever they wanted     They were truly detestable people who played with our emotions     Only people without hearts would do this     to nameless women and children     To see how much they enjoyed this joke     with so much sarcasm     only shows what they truly value.     One could get angry, but could not do anything.     We were obligated to wait the following days,     pleading with God that they would not play another trick.</p>   
       <p>The next day     we saw that still were inspecting around there,     despite being accustomed to be here all day long.     We started to worry after that what happened     approximately an hour later.     They asked us to join with them in the point of inspection that was on the road,     we did nothing.     We did not want them to take us for idiots one more time,     and regretfully, they came     and all of them began to look through our belongings.     I have nothing more than my watch,     a short pair of pants and a shirt;     they took the luxury and my number, (???)     that has been mentioned.     I embarked while we were waiting for the others,     the rest of the group began to make a roar of euphoria.(AWK)     We were very happy to leave but the adventure     was still not over.     Despite everything, we were content to advance     with the goal of finding a place where we could buy clothing,     because we still had none.     We arrived at the sixth refuge.     On the entrance line, I bumped into two of my friends.     We arrived together because one of them     ran away and fell into a trap.     They punished him by putting him in the forest     for three days without food     It is outrageous that you have to pay them to punish you!     At no time should they have seen us as prisoners.     They were filling up their pockets at our expense.     How was it possible to receive punishment     for wanting to follow our plan?     For wanting a better quality of life!     For searching for better sustenance for our families!     This was truly incomprehensible.</p>   
       <p>We did not control anything In this new place.     It began to see the light and everything started to get better.     Some people had spent weeks in this place because     the wanted to sell their numbers     to those who had no patience     My friends and I bought the numbers of those     who were walking the next day.     We spent only one day in that place.     We wanted to move ourselves     as quickly as possible with the hope of reaching     the friends with whom we initiated the voyage.</p>   
       <p>At eight in the morning we had already woken up,     but we could not cook,     because we bought food from an indigenous vendor     who knew how to prepare Haitian food.     We were on line, waiting under the sun since this time.     Everyone was impatient.     Seeing that the boats with the “coyotes” did not arrive,     we asked if there was some problem     and they told us that we had to wait another day.     They saw the high quality goods     we had with us.     We offered us good food and cheap trinkets in exchange,     as if we did not know they value that they had. We did not insult them     because we wanted to remain staying there,     but they could see from a mile away that we were not     doing very well, but they did not see any     reciprocity in us. </p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-24.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      When there was a business,      nobody had a problem in paying      between ten or up to twenty dollars      to get on a boat after spending so many days walking on the road      We were always looking for a way to make the      way seem more rapid and easier.     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>Finally the boats arrived.     We were not asked to pay,     but even so, the “coyotes” made everyone pay.     It was the last boat we had to raise in the river.     All were impatient to reach the next place.     They had told us that there everyone would have     a bed, food, and potable water.     Definitively at these heights of the game,     we no longer believed.     Everything was a mystery for us;     we did not know what we could expect.     Above the boat, the river water seemed calm     but it was dangerous.     There were all types of beasts, but nobody had seen any.     You believed what they told you,     and we were already psychologically prepared to avoid problems     From afar we could hear voices,     which made us grow even more impatient.</p>   
       <p>It was one of the biggest refuges that we had encountered.     Single men were always served last,     which made single men and women look for partners.     For the good of both, the partners shared with each other     the smaller number.     Some looked for a different way,     for example joining with the food and cleaning committee.     Some made this decision, but my friends and I     wanted to see     if there was another way     we could go more quickly.     rapidly.     We wanted to pay,     because throughout the Panamanian route,     it has always been money that passed first.     We did not have a better way,     so what we wanted to try with what we had.     WE had planned something with the soldier in charge     of verifying who left the refuge every day.     The gave us a pass the next day     and we did not talk with anybody     about our plans because     we ourselves to go without anyone knowing.     The next day we prepared to leave.     It appeared that the plan would turn out well ,     but it started with the soldiers discussing among themselves     and this caused that not a single person could leave.</p>   
       <p>In the end, we waited for our date.     The days passed and everything remained the same.     In this refuge, we could take advantage of     attention medical, such as vaccination,     because we had spent many days and nights     feeling very ill, bad, with many limitations.     What we wanted was to be able to speak with our families.     We had to find an ally in order to get WiFi signal     and power to recharge our cellphones.     One paid, but in such a way that we had to make a line,     because all the vendors were available only until     six in the afternoon.     People could not leave their places in line     The persons could not leave these places.     We could stay at the river's shore for as long as we wanted     One night a Haitian took a bath in the river,     he dived into the water and never returned to the surface.     For this reason the people abstained from diving.</p>   
       <p>From far away we heard a car coming,     the one that brought us.     We all stood up to see what was happening.     It was driven by a Haitian</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/Sobrevivientes-25.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      Metetí was one of the most important shelters in Panama,      which is why it was where they gave us      a vaccine against fever and infections.      All of this was thanks to the red cross.     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>This desperate Haitian did not want even want to speak.     We thought that something had happened,     but it was he who looking for us.     This person came from the ultimate refuge, called “20 Days”.     It was a very big refuge.     HE told us that he no longer wanted to stay twenty days there     and that he had bought a bracelet.     There one did not use cards, but bracelets,     and the number of the the bracelet belonged     to a man who had died in the refuge.     He knew him and had been discovered.     Therefore they threatened to deport him;     but he begged, and they had him     return to the three refuges where he now was..     He told us that there was no life there     and that the heat would kill us.     That everyone slept in big tents     and there were numerous soldiers     watching and they were on duty until late.     They ordered us to make our beds and thus we did it.     The next day, like every day,     all of us bottled it up in an activity;     some waited for friends or family     members who had gone to the river,     with the hope that they would return.     People who were arriving got in line     for vaccinations.     Others washed bathrooms and     got assigned to different tasks; it was like a law.     Around two in the afternoon,     some small boats arrived with other persons,     one of them was had a gunshot wound.     This person had been standing in the road,     when they were attacked by two indigenous bearing firearms;     they retreated, but when they ran,     one of them received a gunshot would     when the attackers fired upon them,     more out of fear than of malice.     He survived despite everything.</p>   
       <p>Some people said they were still alive because God exists,     the only true God.     Our religious antecedents are not not good;     everyone knows that there is a spiritual terrible fight     between good and evil in Haiti.     Even if it does not make you a witch voluntarily,     it makes you obligated with finality     to obtain a monetary     gain for your labors.     One of the principal centers of voodoo is the city of my birth.     Haiti is the only country in the world that was consecrated to Satan.     The first time was in 1791, for 200 years,     for which it was the first country to obtain its independence.     Afterwards, in 2005, it realized a new pact with the demon for another 200 years.     After that have come a series well known catastrophes     for the country</p>   
   (USTIN: HARD DISAGREE!!!   )	 (https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/01/pat_robertson_blames_haitian_d.html)       <p>That is, he who is not Christian is satanic.     Surely on the road many have made pacts     or consigned their lives to some spirit     and the Christians to Jehovah, the God of Israel.     Out of luck, the majority of migrants are Baptists.</p>   
         <p>       My departure was the next evening     As I was eager to leave,     I woke up at eight in the morning.     First I bought a coffee by the river,     I put my my pack on my back     and met my friends,     whose had been summoned to leave,     There were two buses,     waiting only to filled up so they could leave.     They started to call the names.     The first bus was almost full with sick persons,       whereas you had to pay for each person who went in the other one,       even for babies.     Finally, they came to my group and we got on,     happy like  every time  we left one place to go to another.     We paid the driver before we left.     We had to go to a Somali and Nepalese refuge,     where we would stay for twenty days,       with spaces that were       not that big,     but they forced us to stay there.</p>   
           <p>In that refuge,       there were not enough places to sleep     and the bathroom was very dirty.     Some of us did not use it.     They watched everyone go to the bathroom.     We were under military control every day,     and again we had no rights whatsoever.       It is shocking that you were paying       to be mistreated.       Totally illogical! Out of place!!! AWK       That we ourselves were paying for this?        Unbelievable!</p>   
        <p>They offered us the same dishes,     white rice with any sauce.     For once I wanted to taste food with flavor,     but it was nowhere to be found.     But no matter, we accepted it.     There was a Haitian girl in that place     who sold food prepared with     the classic seasoning of the Haitian cuisine.     But this food could only be consumed     by those who could afford it;     while those who could not     had to eat what was given at the refuge,     even if it was horrible.</p>   
       <p>We could nothing but sit back and wait.     This place tried our patience a great deal.     The guards accompanied us to the supermarkets      to choose what we wanted,      but under their strict rules.     We could not buy alcohol     or certain things to cook such as rice.      They, amazing as it may seem,      even determined it what you would buy.      They wanted you to buy cereals, milk, candies.      I was under the impression that      they brought us to those places     not out of concern for us,      but to leave money there.     They said that we were rich:     if we could pay so much for this trip,      we must have money.      In general, people believed this      in countries we traversed.</p>   
       <p>Those who were lucky were able to access      the commercial supermarket to      prepare themselves for the final phase of Panama.     In the “R20” -- as we called the 20-day refuge --     you could buy tents, small items,     and other accessories      to try to live      a peaceful moment within it.</p>   
       <p>We spent about three days in that refuge.     On the third evening,     some of the other Haitians and I     had the opportunity to converse with a soldier, who very cautiously  expressed to us his disagreement inconformity     and told us that he was conscience     of how much they made us suffer     and that the Panamanian government was very hard on us     to not show us any sign of respect.     He spoke to us so much that   we wanted to sit down,     but he did not want to raise any suspicions.     because at  the end of the day, he was one of them.     Furthermore, he told us that the worst was yet to come.      This confirmed what we already knew:      no country that would respect us.     In every country we passed thgough,      they abused us and abused us.     We learned so many things that afternoon     that we did not want  to rest,      but we were leaving in the morning      and we needed to sleep.</p>   
        <p>The next day we were about       200 persons in two buses     heading towards the "R20"     It was at this moment that        I noticed how discouraged the Haitians were,       who were already doing things and       living no matter how lucky they were.</p>   
        <p>If you can believe it,       that refuge  was like living in a real ghetto.       At the entrance, they gave us a number       with a wristband to identify us.     Those who were partnered could    benefit from a temporary registration,     while others had to look for their own     ways to sleep in the plastic tents.     It was just a small space with a mattress.</p>   
       <p>Two thousand or more refugees were in that camp,      named after the most of the most popular      communities Port- Au-Prince.      There was even an airport      and a place where buses parked, Petionville,      the block with the best constructed refuge.     The floor was smooth,     the well well arranged.      This block was dominated by the elderly       and the elders of the camp;      the community was called Port-Au-Prince      and it was very valuable.     It was the central block,     located close to the Croix des Bouquets      and its road connected to the other blocks.</p>   
       <p>This zone was filthy and markets were plentiful.      This block was named like this      because the soldiers prevented persons      from sleeping there,    since the bathrooms were washed every two weeks.     The center was the most interesting,     the most popular gambling venues in Haiti:     Before, Poke Palé, Albou, Pénalité, Centurion.     It was a truly not an easy life,      where Haitians could take advantage      of the opportunity      given by the soldiers to go to the supermarket     and spend their money buying and reselling.     At the market  the middle of the center,      the friends of the officers profited from  selling  prepared food from their carts.</p>   
       <p>Everything was planned.      At three in the morning,      fifteen carts came to the center     and sold noodles and plantains,     or chicken with gravy.     They also put their tents in the refuge.      Nothing was free,      you even had to pay for recharging your cell phone      Food was also sold and     and  young people placed bets      and others set about      selling  refreshing drinks and other items      in the streets of the refuge,      Despite this, we had everything to enjoy each afternoon,      after midday the atmospherer was assembled. Some organized a musical band playing Haitian Ra-Ra music     and others gathered to enjoy the presence of     God by holding their religious meetings.     The point was that we were were all busy.</p>   
       <p>From the day I set foot in this camp,     I felt that there would be no peace.     I was my turn see a soldier     leave with his motorcycle     to find a Haitian in order to beat him      where no one was supposd to see,      far from the camp.      We were anxious      not knowing what had happened to the young man.     An hour later, the same motorcycle     returned with thee young man all bloody,     and quickly the Haitians rebelled on principle.     Those who saw it take place     ran after the soldiers,     throwing beers.     A rebellion began.     It looked like a movie, but it was the reality     that we all lived until we reached     the border of Tijuana and San Diego.</p>   
       <p>      I have already commented that the Haitian      is violent by nature: he carries it in his genes.     Abuse is the worst for us,    especially if there is no justification     Here we were many     and we could defend each other    Most of us with bandaged faces,     with sticks and rocks as weapons,     we walked to the Red Cross and the military base     to demand justice.     For this, the soldiers already had left the encampment.     There was not a single soldier,      only those who were in the boat      and those  around the buildings.     We struggled against  the barriers to try to get out,     but all the exits were closed.      They knew that we were going to stay here.     What enflamed us the most was that     after daring to beat him, they took his money.</p>   
        <p>Migration was the institution       that was in charge of the refugees.     They came to ask for peace       and said that they would replace       what had been taken from the young man.     We did not want their peace,  but our justice.       They promised us that they       would go to those officials       and investigate the reason for this act of injustice.     With all these words      we finally calmed down     and asked that we be cared for and     that they make changes to the way of life.     It all came down to one thing:     that they would treat us like human beings --     that they would feed us well,     that we would no longer have to use our little money       on food instead of using it in our voyage;       that they respect the refugees       and that they respect the name on the list       of  people       who would be sent to Costa Rica every day,       without them selling places in line.     But everything remained just words, nothing changed.     Nothing was modified.     Gullible us for thinking so.     How to change such a corrupt way of life?</p>   
 	       <p>They fed us food that     not even our pets would have eaten.     Two plates a day,     after sounding the alarm to make us form a line.     THere were fights for places.     It was  obvious that we all wanted to eat     and it was inevitable     that people would fight for the food,     but it would run out before the end of the line.      The advantage of being      a women or a child here was enviable,     because they had priority.     Some women took advantage of this opportunity     by going through the line several times,    either so that a friend could eat     or so that her husband could have two plates.     When the soldiers learned of this practice,     they had to put pressure and  more security on the line.     A line of almost 500 persons,     who were served two spoonfuls of fat-free rice.     The children were the first to have diarrhea.</p>   
       <p>On the other hand,     the rest of the people engaged in gambling     to pass the time     and bought food at least once a day.</p>   
        <p> There were only black people in the refuge,       but from different countries.       The most notable were the Haitians       because they had total control of the terrain.       If you wanted to leave as quickly as possible,       you had to buy a wristband from a Haitian       or by other means.     Everyone had their little secret or a way of earning money.       You could not imagine it,       but living there was really like being in a ghetto.     There were some who knew how to cut hair and       used their  hairdressing skills to get out.       This included women we met who spent time     doing manicures, pedicures, hair weaving or other things.       They, like the men, sought their own means.       At night, the children also     turned into vendors, selling bread and milk     to help their parents.       Those who did nothing useful     found a cool place under a tree     to relax, to play dominoes or to discuss global politics.     Everyone occupied themselves with something.</p>   
       <p>     On the road we had lost a friend.     The camp was the ideal place to encounter him     because nobody could be alone in this refuge.     The rules of the encampment required you to have a friend with you.     If not, life would become very complicated     because of all the dangers present.     Everyone had their team.</p>   
       <p>     Some of my friends went to the airport.     They came to see if they knew anyone     among the new arrivals     so that they could help them.     When we see each other, we get so happy;     it really makes us so excited to finally meet up again.      We were so happy to reunite with old friends,     a family member or a spouse.     My friends lived in a place with a lot of sun,     where oldest people lived.     We all had a plan, but always with the same goal:     to use our intelligence every day     to get a plate of food and     buy a pack of cigarettes.</p>   
           <p>During the day, those of our clan       played games of chance, --       like *beftoufe albou* --     listened to music and sold cigarettes.     Others watched the food vending carts arrive.     Everyone who did not want to get in line     for free food were forced     to go to the city center     to see the merchants.     We had other options.     With the tropical sun     it was difficult to do work necessary     for survival during the day.     As soon as we ate,     we played all kinds of games,     relaxing under the trees.     We took an bus that     brought us to the  streams.     There there was potable water to drink,     to bathe and to wash our clothing.       At the end of the day,       we all began to prepare for soccer.     Even the soldiers,     took  places in the field to attend the game.     The Africans formed their teams     and the Haitians formed theirs,     generally giving the other teams a thrashing.     Between 600 and 700 persons attended,     and we played with pleasure and mutual respect.     At night, everyone formed a watch brigade     to supervise those who wanted to go to their secret places     without the soldiers stopping them     One night, when we were watching,     we sensed a movement --     some people were escaping.     They had paid a Haitian woman     who had direct contact with a chief of the command.     She obtained a percentage for each person     referred to the chief,     but she was found out     and the chief handed her over     to the clutches of the Haitians. It went poorly.       Some of us did not want       to hurt her because       we  knew that all of us       had to try to earn money       in any manner possible     and that was hers.       The woman was annoyed,       her behavior was deplorable --        actually, all she tried to do       was to calm the       people who wanted to hurt her.    </p>   
          <p>Each time someone wanted to leave,      the numbers wer delayed     and we spent more days in the refuge.     If the person bought a wristband,     it meant that it the person's place     was reserved,     and we did not have any problems with these types of practice.     Pregnant women or those who had children     enjoyed the privilege of passing first.     If they arrived one day,     they could go to Costa Rica the next day.     Each day one hundred persons were sent      but if the soldiers sold thirty places      out of those one hundred,     then thirty people had to wait two more days.     And if fifty women with children arrived,     then fifty persons would lose their places and     would have to wait another two days in the refuge.     This is why they made a decision:     It was said that,     if the children were brave enough to cross the Darien Gap,     then they were brave enough to wait their turn.      Furthermore, we did not really have to wait that long,      since many  arrived pregnant or sick,     so instead of leaving  for Costa Rica,     they were taken to the hospital</p>   
       <p>      Every day that passed      we were closer to leaving that place.     I counted the days.      I am a restless person who  always needs to be on the move      and who always wants to travel, to advance my project.     I wondered how Costa Rica would be     in comparison to other countries</p>   
       <p>The arrival to Costa Rica was at night;     it was impossible to get processed at that time,     so we had to wait on the Panamanian border     until  the Costa Rican migration office opened,     where we  had to make the necessary arrangements      to cross the country.     It was best to arrive during the week     so that you could pass early next morning;     otherwise, if we arrived on Friday night,     we would have to wait until Monday.</p>

       <p>Chapter VI. Costa Rica</p>   
       <p>Free land</p>   
       <p>     That night on the border was an unforgettable experience.     Legally, we were not supposed to be allowed  to cross,     but we knew that the police were     not going to say anything if we did.     We had discovered easy ways     to break the rules without causing trouble.     Between the two these two countries     was a commercial plaza that touched     a point in Panama and another in Costa Rica.     We discovered that there was     no form of  restriction on this border --     strangely, the border had a free market</p>   
       <p> People who had prior knowledge     of how to handle the situation     crossed without problems.      Some friends who already had      already gotten their papers      would arrive at the border      in the evening      to see     if any friends or family members       arrived,      with the intention of      explaining  how we could cross      without anybody seeing us.     Almost all nighttime activities     happened in Costa Rica,     which is why nobody wanted     to stay in Panamanian territory.</p>   
       <p>After such an exhausting voyage (journey?)),     nobody wanted to sleep on a piece of carton in a parking lot.     Almost everybody  crossed over to Costa Rica      to find a hotel or a friend      who already had a place     to spend the night or the weekend.</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/SobrevivSecondHalf-2.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      Every morning approximately one hundred migrants      waited in front of the border of Panama and Costa Rica      at  8:00 a.m.      for the Costa Rican migration agents,      so  they could cross the country.     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>As far as I was concerned,     the evening was very pleasant,    because I met      many friends       I had not seen for a long time.     To celebrate the meeting,     we went to a club on the outskirts of the city and     we spent a night with beer, cigars and women;      After what we had lived through,      we could not ask for anything better.     All we wanted after such adversity was to distract ourselves.     During the night, however, we took turns    going to the border to     to corroborate how things were going.     Many of the migrants from the rest of the group     made the decision to wait for others at the border,      as they were worried      that their friends had  taken too long.     They decided to stay instead of going out to have fun.      At the end of the night      my friends brought me to sleep at a hotel      where they were staying,      knowing that I would have to wake up  early     to go with the group.</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/SobrevivSecondHalf-1.jpg"/>     <figcaption>       On the border of Panama and Costa Rica,       after a sleepless night.

                   <p>===================== SECOND/FIRST DRAFT =====================</p> 	
          <p>At six in the morning the next day, the soldiers came.     At this hour, everyone was already in the parking lot     and they started to go through the list.     After they went through the list,     they gave us permission to go buy things to eat,     but it was someone outside of our group     was prohibited from approaching us.     Something illogical in the rules,     but according the them it was to avoid problems.     At eight in the morning     the Costa Rican immigration gave permission     so for the first group to come,     which fortunately was mine.     We seemed like strange beasts for the citizens in this place.     Everyone who passed by on the street     was observed by this area's residents,     as if none had even seen a human being who looked like us,     since we were all of distinct nationalities.     We felt as if we were under a microscope,     the people looked like they were analyzing us     as if we were extraterrestrials or something similar.     Human beings are very strange.     Let's hope that the moment arrives     when we humans will understand the importance     of respecting each other,     so that we can put aside stigmas and useless prejudices,     that will not benefit us but will destroy us.     Our color is not synonymous with being aggressive or wicked,     how they make to feel not only us , (???)     but to the other nationalities as well.</p>   
       <p>We walked about ten minutes to arrive at the immigration office.     When we arrived,     we have to make a line to give our personal information,     name, nationality, age, civil status, and so on.     Next, they gave us gave us an appointment in another city,     close to the shelter where we needed go     for the visa.     To our surprise,     my group was the only one that received their visa the same day,     because the shelter did not have any more space.     This allowed us to go more quickly to buy tickets     towards Peña Blanca, the last city in Costa Rica,     There the misery of the population could be appreciated; much     so many migrants were so obviously being trafficked illegally,     while the authorities remained at the margins.</p>   
       <p>Almost everyone wanted to stay at the border     to rest a little after our experiences in Panama.     We wanted to have a bit of freedom     and to wait for some of our friends     who still had not arrived.     We paid twenty dollars a day for each room,     but each room had two beds and each bed could have two persons.     Thus each of us paid five dollars a day     and almost twenty dollars all together. (USTIN -- IS THIS RIGHT? NOT 20 PER PERSON)     This was not a problem for some,     but there were also people who could not pay for the hotel,     thus they used a neighboring parking lot to sleep,     while others looked for a cheap hotel,     with only a bed and no television.     Other persons very intelligent, that for some reason knew     stopped there.     They rented a house to cook and sold food     to others who were arriving</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/SobrevivSecondHalf-3.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      On the border of Costa Rica and Nicaragua,      people used the street as a kitchen and      committed suicide on the highways,      Even some who did not have time to go to the bathroom at night      did so in the morning on the side or the highway     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p> To reflect on it,     renting a house is not expensive,     because it could be twenty dollars a day, for more than ten persons.     Clearly, without mattresses,     but the migrants sleep on cartons which     they acquire in the streets and the marketplace.     The people accommodate themselves in some manner on the border.     In almost all countries that we crossed there existed a manner to save money, but very little there was.     But for disgrace many people are of a hard and insensible heart, thus they cover for everything they charge     you for everything, the bathroom, to recharge your cell phone, etc.</p>   
        <p>One the border,     many women were responsible for renting the hotels or houses to the migrants,     and also they would offer their bodies for ten or five dollars,     truly for the misery of money.     And thus, logically at this price and with the stress around,     the bachelors made a line same as when they were going to eat.     My friends and me as well,     because it was the perfect opportunity to spend time with a woman.</p>   
       <p>     In the morning we were convinced that if we did not     have any friends arriving at the border,     in order to tell them what to do after registering.     Almost all the people who had come with us     had already caught the road the road towards the Nicaraguan border.     Those who did not have passports     remained behind     so that earn money to send back to a family member.     One of the ways of receiving money was     through knowledge of the transfer office.     Luck for us, we had two friends and     another Venezuelan-naturalized Haitian who worked at an office,     who helped the Haitians to receive money     -- of course, for an extra fee     They charged different fees,     some charged five percent of the total that you sent,     which was convenient because the people received almost all the money     needed to reach the Nicaraguan border without getting stopped.     You had to know that at the Nicaraguan border     it was not easy to receive a money transfer,     which is why it was better to pay 5% or more here.     There was no other option.</p>   
       <p>Under these circumstances I realized     that really I had brought barely any money with myself.     My friends planned to leave in two days and     I truly reacted by realizing that I did not     have any reason to remain on the frontier.     I took advantage of staying with them     because I ate with them and     they took charge of my hotel costs     Therefore to whom did I belong here without hopes? (AWK)</p>   
        <p>Nobody in their right mind     would be capable of staying here at the border,     because the economic grew more impoverished day by day.     Logically, more days meant more expenses.     The only ones who benefited -- if you wanted to call them that --     were the Haitians who sold prepared foods,     whose intention was to overcome the investment     and to earn and gain extra money to continue     their business on the Nicaraguan border and to continue advancing.</p>   
       <p>The day that I marched from Paso Canoas to go to Peña Blanca was a dark day.     It was alone in the bus, surrounded by people I did not know.     We left after midday.     Around the four in the afternoon     the immigration bus arrived with specially priced stickers.     They made a one-day solo voyage of one day in several vans,     which lasted sixteen hours, including a rest     before reaching San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica.     When we arrived we rest again for two hours,     before taking the last bus to the Nicaraguan border.</p>   
       <p>Arriving at the border of Costa Rica and Nicaragua     made me observe the game of life and     called much of mu attention to the situation of the Nicaraguans.     It was incredible to see     how people can live in the middle of the garbage where they eat and sleep.     Nicaragua did not have formal shelters like other countries;     there you can move yourself freely,     but you must be very careful.     They do not receive you with food,     everyone has to make themselves responsible for eating,     all costs running against our account,     there was not a single authority or source of aid for which we could wait,     is not a single authority or aid that we could wait,     at least they did not have anything for the Nicaraguan residents.     Under these circumstances,     it became complicated to think that we would reach     on the estimate date of our goal.     We thought we would arrive the November 8.</p>   
        <p>We discovered that there was another option close to the Red Cross,     almost 15 kilometers away from the migration office were two refuges,     one for families and the other was for whomever needed it.     Because they were very far away,     it would at least make us very hungry     but we did not have another option, so we went.     We preferred to stay moving.     We wanted to leave the frontier,     it was a very depressing;     we had no option other than to cook in the street, eat in the street,     and do our business in the street.     Many tried to travel illegally the bus drivers or with the “coyotes”,     but without success.     As they did not have a lot of money they became refugees.     Before this these Haitians were very (bastante) rebellious.     They did not obey the authorities     when then told them that     they had to go to a refuge instead of     being in the street,     trying to sell food, recharge their cell phone batteries,     cut hair or braiding extensions,     putting their gambling tables close to the vagabonds     and looking for the way to earn money in whatever form,     including prostitution</p>   
       <p>Unfortunately, Nicaraguan women also     started to do business with the Haitians.     They were very nice, they rented a room where     they woke up the men for five dollars     with whatever women were picked,     even three or more to be found one the room.     At the edge of these streets there was music and commotion.     As much thalgarabía at at the time I asked myself whether I truly was on a voyage.     We saw so many things that it confused me.     There were so many worldly diversions     and it could be said that     thanks to those distractions     we could feel the taste. (???)     It was strange that within the misery where we were,     we could have ephemeral moments of happiness.</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/SobrevivSecondHalf-4.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      A way that we all got used to sleeping,      especially those who had families.      Whey looked for a way to put tents on the street or in a favorable location.     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>The “coyotes” cost a thousand dollars per person     and they acquired one hundred persons or more;     in total, they earned 100,000 dollars.     And they didn't only do a single trip per week, but several.     Their earnings were enormous.</p>   
       <p>The “coyotes” were very ready (LISTOS???).     At times the voyages they paid for did not happen,     which is why people stayed on their border for a long time.     There were people who lost for their money     on poorly organized voyages     who still could not recuperate anything.     But they acquired experience     and this experience served to us,     but they warned us of the different kinds of traffickers.     Some could take you to Honduras in a day     and some in a few more, depending on the connection</p>   
       <p>The persons who were traveling on border     and who fell in the hands of opportunist traffickers     were often abandoned by their families,     such that they could not continue economically supporting     their voyages indefinitely,     so that they had to look for a way to survive     going to the refuges to be able to eat.     Or well, there were people who had compassion on them     and helped them with whatever they could.     In the case of those who traveled on foot from Costa Rica to Honduras,     some arrived successfully,     the majority did not make it.</p>   
       <p>Thank God we knew two refuges,     safe and well-located places,     close to the city La Cruz,     headquarters for the Canadian officials and the Red Cross.     Families were not separated in the first refuge,     there were dozens of tent.     Each tent had a capacity for around twenty people.     To be accepted in the refuge,     you had to get a visa before leaving the Panama-Costa Rica border,     where they gave a wristband to wear until you left the refuge.     Here they offered medical services,     a food kit which allowed you to feed yourself for a week     and if the tent only had fifteen persons, you ate very well.</p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/SobrevivSecondHalf-5.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      Many if us cried for different reasons:      to lament that they had left Brazil      to become object of abuse by      people who took advantage of the situation      Others were crying for friends and family members      who did not have the opportunity to exit the jungle;      others cried out of joy, to still be alive;      others, like this woman, cried after trying to go      to Honduras through Nicaragua,      and unfortunately were unable to achieve that goal     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>The place had a kitchen made out of blocks;     the men cut the wood that immigration officials     brought to the place, to be able to cook.     They had clean showers to start with     but at the end everything became dirty and mistreated.     The area was very tranquil and relaxing for resting     and we had the opportunity to recharge our cell phones.     Apparently we were all happy.     Fortunately the children had their own space to play,     and the little ones played soccer at midday .</p>   
       <p>The second refuge was located forty five minutes from there,     in the zone of Jobo, which was in front of the river.     There were adults in the beach.     This refuge was similar to the previous one in terms of the amount of food,     the security, and the bathrooms.     One breathed the same tranquility In how much the food, the security and the bathrooms were the same as the previous refuge,     one inhaled the same sense of tranquility</p>   
        <p>     Although we were calmly enjoying this rest,     we were left with the same intentions to continue the voyage.     In the same way that every morning we went to verify     if the traffickers had any exits in the door.     Luckily we knew who were the most effective traffickers,     of Costa Rican and Nicaraguan nationality.     They were Les Jumeaux, Manual, Pedro, Neg Bannann, Tibian (Haití), Carlos Komandan.     There were many others. Each one of them had different prices.     The most expensive were $1300, $1200, $1100, $1000 and $900     and the others were from $400 to $700.     We knew that the more expensive voyages were the most secure     so we ignored those from $400 to $700.     Incredible the traffickers were more popular than the politicians     in the city.     In this circle of persons there was everything,     since they helped them for a payment, until they rob you.     All well organized, some by land, others by sea.    </p>   
       <p>     To start the voyage,     we had to put or names on a list and     to give $100 in advance,     for which they gave us a departure date     that depended on the number of people     registered.     Some people paid for than that     to go more rapidly and a few were going     with those who paid little so that they     would not lose time waiting,     since it was without a guarantee.     While those who paid a lot they     gave a guarantee, giving them     the opportunity again if something     went badly     If things did not go well, the     Nicaraguan police would send you back to Costa Rica.    </p>   
       <p>     The voyages of the traffickers were not easy.     We walked for hours in the forest,     something which was no fun.     Later we connected with a van     which left us close to a river     which we had to cross.     The soldiers knew beforehand that the     people were coming there,     therefore occasionally there     they made you return to Costa Rica.     On other occasions, traffickers     brought people to Honduras     without any danger    </p>   
       <p>     The "coyotes" in the forest had mercenaries,     who were in charge of robbing people     and raping women,     taking from them all their honor.     One of the wives of these delinquents -- who was Haitians     -- went and investigated the Haitians     to know which had more more and to attack them on the road,     threatening them and taking their belongings from them.     Some groups suffered more than other.     Many more people did not reach Honduras,     because they had to return to Costa Rica    </p>   
       <p>     I knew a story of a woman who was raped in the forest.     On this voyage there were more than 120 persons     and the bandits seized everyone was on the road,     two in front with rifles and two in back,     and they started to examine everyone to take their belongings     from them. They beat the men and they put their fingers     in the vaginas of the women or raped them.     So thus, this group was able to reach Honduras,     but the woman who was raped separated from the group.,     they did not have mercy on her and returned her to Costa Rica.     This woman had such shame that I say that she said     that they had not done anything;     but someone who knew her saw everything, she narrated.    </p>
       <p>     I could not trust anyone,     thus here they said many lies in order     to earn money or to survive     The same traffickers when you were inside the forest     immediately had an ambush,     because they were well organized.     This was one of the reasons why     people wanted to go by water.     The problem is that there there was no     kind of protection     and you could die drowning     Many of us did not know how to swim.    </p>   
   <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/SobrevivSecondHalf-6.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      There was a category of poverty on the border      between Costa Rica and Nicaragua,      there were no authorities who waited for us,      nobody offered us anything      On this border only those who had money      had something to eat.     </figcaption>    </figure>   
   <p>    On one occasion, one of the boats did not reach the port,    it was lost on the bottom of the sea with several migrants.    And in another case, a baby fell in the water    and disgracefully the captain of the ship did    not want to stop. Everyone was angry and desperate    but -- even though the people wanted to help --    it wasn't possible to do so. The ship had to follow    its course. When the people dropped their suitcases    or their backpacks, at least they waited.   </p>
   <p>    Another way to travel was on the land route    within a trailer which passed by customs.    The drivers did it when was found someone    known to them working in customs. It was    the quickest way to reach Honduras.    Every night there were people waiting    for some driver to help them continue. Sometimes    they did it, but in the same there were traps,    because thieves were spying.   </p>

       <p>Chapter VII. Nicaragua</p>   
       <p> Forbidden land</p>   
       <p> Nicaragua is the only country     we could not cross     because it lacks diplomatic relations with Haiti.     All power in this country depends upon its president.     Because of the migrants,     the Nicaraguan soldiers have to work every day.     The first time that I arrived to this land was     with a group on Cubans.     This type of voyage has a proper name.     We called it "via" (way), derived from the     Spanish word "viaje" (voyage).     Cubans do not voyage frequently with Haitians     because they have their own contacts     and in fact     each nation has its own style of voyaging.    </p>   
       <p> I have to make a parenthesis to explain     about a Senegalese person.     They are brave;     he had crossed all of Nicaragua on foot,     it was very good (LISTO) in his recounting (traveling?),     but in each strategic place he had marked     and left a sign     thinking, clearly,     the possibility could exist that he would be returned.     Without a doubt he was disposed     to try it again     in case that, when he arrived in Honduras,     they returned him to Costa Rica.</p>   
       <p> When they effectively (AWK) returned him,     he picked up all the other Africans and they took the same road.     No Haitian counted with this grade of valiance.     The "coyote" that brought us asked us     if we were valiant, and that,     if we were not,     well then he would leave us     because that was going to be a necessity,     yet that he would leave us waiting in Honduras,     at the other end of Nicaragua,     where it would cost us half the price.     The other half was going to be made     to come with a friend     who awaited our advice of what     we had already completed our part     and we paid him the other half.     The "coyote" told us that we were going to be     in approximately four hours.     He had taken days arriving in Panama,     thus that these four hours felt     like a fraction of a second.    </p>   
       <p> He presented three guides to cross --     two bases of police and for that     they could take us to a free place.     In the group there were two babies     and this caused us to worry     due to the fact that     it was very easy to be found     with the cry of a baby,     because the soldiers     were never very far     in case that     someone started to cry.     Definitely this augmented     our nervousness and adrenaline.     After we stared to walk     we felt closer to Honduras.     After approximately one hour of marching,     we came to a point very close to the soldiers,     but by luck they did not see us.     Two of them appeared on a motorcycle     and immediately we echamos all al suelo     It s difficult to describe the pesadez     which you can feel in these circumstances,     breathing is agitated through the fear     and the insecurity     that we live in those moments.     Only who lives those circumstances     can understand it.     I don't think you could imagine     the risk that we took every day.     There were so many dangers     in these sendas that     rerun suffering hunger, thirst, saints,     insect bites and     extreme agotamiento physical.    </p>   
       <p> We were on the road for almost six hours!     And we still hadn't arrived at the place where we should be     or even worse was that there was no sign (signal?)     After this we ere all a bit more worried.     W e arrived at a pint where there was a change of guides     They told us -- but I think it was to make us scared (?) atemorizarnos     that all of this was according to plan, that we should continue on     with the fresh new guides,     who conducted us to the connection.     The connection wants to say the second part of the *via*.     The Cubans did no want to change the guide,     but we saw ourselves obligated to take him     because we could not stay in the jungle.     We continued our route until the fall of night.     The fear, the separation and the GANAS     to see another day be born in our hearts.     There were occasion s in which every time     that one of us should cross a field of corn,     everyone ran, until the arrived to an iron lamp,     but on occasions those alambres de fierro     were feeding off the electrical current.     And if for some strange reason one did not have     the time to escape, would have to leave and     trespass the gates (alambers),     which would be a payment very expensive     for traveling,     as well as risking enormously your life.    </p>   
       <p> After crossing so many fields,     we rested in the afternoon     There had not passed even two minutes     when thieves attacked us,     the result of being that those thieves were     the three first guides.     In the act we realized who they were     because they had not changed their shirts     they only ha panuelos which covered     the face and the more delgado was     the easiest to distinguish.     The question was whether they were     "armed to the teeth" with a variety of firearms     including a 9mm, knives and machetes.     Two of the were in front, us in the middle and     others in back of us.     These people without scruples     utilized these tactics to esculcarnos     Unfortunately they did not know respect     towards anyone,     not even towards women did they have compassion.     ALl the desfachatez and without miramientos     they fires ther shirts and put our hands against the calzonez     They wanted everything1 It did not matter how much it cost!</p>   
       <p> There are thieves and rapists who take     a their (antojo) to all the people who     cross their path.     Everything that happens is planned;     the other guides went to one side,     and told us that, if anyone followed them, that person would die     After all this we did not intends to follow them</p>   
       <p> The Cubans got extremely angry,     so it was not the first time that that had happened;     they had already lost almost everything,     same as most.     Nice rolled in and with it rain,     we did not have a place where we could protect the children.     It was an extremely cold night and hard to take     but we made it one more time.     Truly we felt that evening that     God had saved us.     I can say that we rested peacefully,     so before there was walking too much     to arrive at the connection.     TO continue, the guides asked us to     make change of our money,     surely that we were going to give them some.     Clearly not!     Now more than ever we did not trust them,     their words were pure lies.     In this way one never should trust anybody.     It's impossible</p>   
       <p> The human being is so cruel, so evil;     pure heartless people,     cegada for their own benefit,     something depressing.     His justification for taking our money     was supposedly to defend it against other assaults,     but they were the only ones who were not being esculcados.     What we wanted to watch for, if then is wasn't anything.     This is what we did now excel this,     that we were penniless. (we hadn't a penny?)</p>   
       <p> To arrive them we asked them     if we could talk on the telephone with the person     who is contracted the voyage,     in order to explain to him what was happening,     but he negated that (nego).     He did not want to talk to us,     he said that we lacked a part of the money     to get to (realizar) the connection*.     We tried to convince him that we paid him at the start,     but the guides did not want to continue speaking with us     They told us that it would be better     to leave him a message     and that they would deliver it to him.     The voyage contractor was a thing     and was insinuating that     we Haitians had not paid,     despite that Cubans had sent him a message     telling him that they paid what was owed.</p>   
       <p> We became (vimos?)     obligated to go for our own good (cuenta).     It was very close to the highway     and nos percatamos that there would be traffic and someone would see us.     Some police passed nearby.     After waiting three or four hours,     a van which had done the connection did not     arrive and it had already passed four in the afternoon.     Everyone began to worry that     we could not emprender the voyage     and that we had to spend another     evening in the jungle.     Nobody had seen where     it had gone the guides     and unfortunately (de repente)     a police car arrived.     The Cubans told them     se echaron     to run.     In fact we all ran except the women who had babies.     Acontecio ( rember     a Haitian friend and a Cuban running, the police followed them     and we did not know them,     we lost them on the road.</p>   
       <p> It could be said that the *via* had gone badly.     Thus we had to try to leave     and to see what we were going to do --     a new strategy.     Despite that we wanted to maintain in a group,     in a part se retrio,     possibly the arrival of the police.</p>   
       <p> we left towards the highway     some of us acostabos     and two Cubans made signs to the cars on the toad     to try to ask them for aventon     that they could get us closer to the Honduran border     but in reality     at last we were two hours from Costa Rica.     Each time we saw a automobile     we were afraid that we would be returned to Costa Rica.     We ran the risk of losing our money and our voyage     and we had to realize it again completely,     because most of the people who organized the *via* were thieves.     When we began to run,     an automobile of the armed forces took us by surprise.     They told us that we should not worry, that we should stay calm.     After evening passed,     we we returned to Costa Rica in the morning.     As soon as we arrived at his base,     we saw the rest of the group that     had left on the other *via*. After the Red cross gave us food and used clothe.     We were lied to because could not have arrived in Honduras,     but also happy that we did not have to spend     another day in the jungle.</p>   
       <p> Each one had a     colchoneta en el suelo     and we drank the same water as     un pozo     that the soldiers drank.     And we madea hoyo     to go to the bathroom,     which competed with what the soldiers     because there was not a bathroom with drainage.     It was a Nicaraguan military base.     In the morning we continued on the route to Costa Rica     with the soldiers who accompanied us.     As far as we had come, we went in the direction     we came from (nos proporciono)     the person who had organized this *via*,     but that that was     at his house     nor did we see anyone,     no even his dog.     We could not go to the police     with this type of unauthorized travels voyage.     It was a decision that we took for our cuenta     and we had to take responsibility for it.     Every time     we denounced a guide on the voyage,     they stopped it only to calm the group down,     but after they lo saltaban (assaulted?)     and took his money.     They were some     evildoers who paid to people in order to watch us.     Our only hope was that     everyone would testify before in the Halls of Justice     at the end of our days.</p>   
       <p> Thank god they had not robbed our cell phones,     only mine.     The persons took me for crazy was because     those who had invited to travel     with some man and     did not have a cent.     I had to meet another way to leave Costa Rica     with some people in order     to recuperate my tranquility. restore my calm. </p>   
       <p> The same day that started     my broken fracasado voyage     there was a friend who invited     me to travel within an container.     I refused him because I was confident trusted     my original plan,     but in mine there was a disaster fracaso     and theirs had had success.     This friend put me in contact     with the same travel agent conductor del camion     in order to convince him to organize another voyage.     I was afraid because I knew beforehand that some people     had been dead in these cajas, but the conductor was different,</p>   
       <p> The container had a great gujero underneath     the truck at the end of which air could enter,     and my work was to reunite about thirty people.     If I gathered together the people,     I and my friends could travel for free.     But imagine it     Who could trust someone     who immediately after had organized     a voyage fracadado.     No matter,     also they wanted to know that the     conductor always had success     in his voyages     and our voyage     was preseen for Sunday.</p>   
       <p> </p>   
       <p> As far as me,     I met up with more than forty persons     for the Sunday departure.     All were impatient,     but the conductor called us and told us that he could not this Sunday     and we had to wait for the next one.     I could not do any sort of reclamo     due to they had the bolsillo empty,     but those who did not have any patience took another route;     some successfully and some no; and when they returned they said     "Yes, I know, I should have waited"</p>   
       <p> Days passed super slowly     and I had little patience.     TO speak truthfully,     we were filled with impatience, discontent;     because it appeared that nobody was leaving well.     When Sunday finally came,     I did not even have time to eat because I     was focused on meeting up with people from the list     and others who added themselves on.     In our meeting point,     close to a gasoline station,     I had collected the money and paid half of the total for everyone,     and the rest when we arrived.     My important things went inside a suitcase with the conductor    </p>   
       <p> Everyday there were the same tasks. One had to walk for hours before making     the connection, passing the electrified lampposts and other things.     We spent the night in the house of one of the guides to     hydrate ourselves before changing     with another group of guides,     who formed part of the plan.     WE were in changeling in the middle of nothing.     We heard only birds and the wind     rosando the tree branches.     Some times we asked ourselves why we were making such sacrifices,     but the answer was that we knew.     WE are humans and the     aislamiento     is more strong than us.</p>   
       <p>After many hours walking     in the middle of the forest,     we were arriving at the connection point.     When they gave us to get in the container     we started to run like crazy people,     we fought among each other. Once everyone was in the container,     the conductor passed out water for the voyage to everyone.     We needed to stay silent until we reached Honduras.     The voyage was quicker than we thought,     because we left at eighths at night and arrived at four in the mourning.     The experience of the container was marvelous because we did not see anything     of the exterior. It could be said that it was a sensation of     alleviation (alivio).     We only had to wait for the conductor     to give us the signal to get off.     And when we got off, we walked for more or less an hour to cross the Nicaraguan border to arrive at Honduras.     Blessed God, we had arrived.     Everything went well.     Despite all the pains that we passed on the rode     finally god showed us a way to leave. Hallelujah!</p>

       <p>Chapter VIII. Honduras</p>   
       <p> Imminent Victory</p>   
        <p> after months of misery     crossing through the forest,     physical and emotional suffering,     nobody could wait to lograr reach Honduras.     All this in truth was     a proof of supervivencia and thanks to God     we left afoat.     Some of us said that the road began in Honduras,     because we lacked only two countries, Guatemala and Mexico,     to reach our destination, which was the United States of America.     Honduras was one of the countries which excepted the Haitians without a problem while Panama we had     to say that we were Africans     In Honduras they knew well that we were Haitians     who came from Brazil Chile Ecuador Venezuela and other places     When we got there, we arrived dirty tired and hungry     The only thing we wanted immensely was first to wash eat and sleep.     Most did not have clothing     It was very nice to see how everyone behaved with what we had.    </p>   
       <p> there were different groups when we we arrived. Some groups had spent many days in Nicaragua     before arriving in Honduras,     but us, thanks to god solely were there one evening.     At eight in the morning,     we had to warn in the migration offices that we were in the country.     this allowed us to have rights to an appointment for which we should wait two or three days,     depending , for the power to have the paper that would allow us to cross the country.     The same day when you sign the paper,     you co promise to leave the country.     thanks to that many Haitians stay in this place because they do not have     money to pay the ticket of travel. Therefore it is better to decide     to not sign it. Without any doubt, we felt closer to the objective     and with more calm.     Until it could me said that we had won to continue with he adventure     because Honduras did not have any repression. everything was calm</p>   
        <p> In Honduras, we could rent a hotel,     but we preferred to rent an apartment room,     because in a hotel you can't cook and     we did not have much money.     We weren't looking for comfort,     only to cover our basic necessities</p>   
       <p> Forbidden land</p>   
       <p> We knew beforehand that we should not lose more time;     everything must be planned correctly,     like we had done since we left Brazil.     The reason for our urgency was that it     was the period when president Obama was concluding soon.     We were al tanto of the news,     of the political climate for the power     that was living in the United Sates,     WE erroneously thought that it was this president     would give us political asylum and open the doors     for our benefit.     Nothing could be further from the reality,     because the benefit was not for all.     Obama was one of the presidents who more deportations     during his mandate (rule?)     In this moment, the elections between candidates     was very closed and we knew its political tendencies.     WE knew that if Donald Trump won the things would     not result to our favor.    </p>   
       <p> When we arrived at the apartment we were renting,     we took a bath and saw how to move to buy food.     Until that moment we were six Haitians.     I did not have a cell phone thanks to the thieves     who had left me incommunicado.     I had to buy one in order to have the power     to be in contact with my mother, who was worried about me.     But first we had to change ourselves because there was a lot of     time in the same clothes and we needed to go buy something new.     Nevertheless, despite what we thought about doing,     we relaxes some minutes, drank some beers     and listened to music.     We discussed our experiences in those months     For those moment, it was already three months of travel (recorrido)</p>   
       <p> There was talk of leaving to the pasear,     to dance,     to know people and have fun,     but as we were very tired and the night very long,     we stayed and slept</p>   
       <p> In the morning, when we woke up we had to go     in search of a Haitian who had more time here,     thus for whatever reason we stayed in this country.     They had passed up his information,     thus already man had crossed they did not know.     He was the only one who could explain to us     how was the situation in the migration offices.     We felt a certain anxiety and we did not     want to lose tie,     but also we did not want to     get their too quickly.     Some Haitians who arrived     a week before us     brought us to a plaza     to buy clothes and cheap cell phones.     I wanted to talk to my mother because     the day was he birthday,     November 28.     For it I got $500 organized a voyage.     I cam to integrate join a group to be able     to buy a cell phone and to call     my mother to wish her a happy birthday    </p>   
       <p> We went to the market to buy things     to cook and it could be said     that we passed an extremely agreeable and relaxing day.     At night, everyone was of good humor,     the climate was good and we went to enjoy this space.     It is curious how you learn to enjoy thing only in situations like that.     When the human being has everything,     sometimes they do not enjoy it.     Nevertheless, us each space     that we had we treated it to pass well.     We did not know how many days we were going to     stay and we wanted to take things calmly,     to take our times,     because after we leave everything will change.     We started --     with the insecurities, with the fears,     lidiabamos     with all call of thoughts and feelings,     the stress came back     and we suffered the same and other necessities.</p>   
       <p> We drank a beer in one of the plazas,     which was the most seen by the Hondurans     because they do not drink beer in the street,     but for ignorance we did it.     We did not know that it was prohibited in the country.     WE had no knowledge (conocimiento -- contrast with saber)     of that norm.     After a few moments came two policemen     and asked us that we should follow them     to the delegation     and when we arrived     they gave us papers to return us to Nicaragua,     because what we were doing was illegal.     We tried various forms of negotiation.     We begged them to let us go,     but they did not accept el trato. (the effort? the attempt?)</p>   
       <p> They told us that if they returned us to Nicaragua     we would have to start again,     but now without money     why we did not have     and our families was not in any condition to help us.     It was a terrible situation     and a shame for our families     if they entered that the police     and     esposado     for the cause of drinking in the street.     Therefore, we began to see that there     was another way to free us and to avoid     being returned.     In our group there was a friend     who spoke perfect Spanish,     as well as the inspector     remained impression of his fluency.     And at the end the inspector     told us that he could bring us conditionally;     he warned us that the next day we had to leave the country     if they were not going to report to     the migration office for this same situation.     They grabbed us with a cooler filled with beer     and they had it.     Very cautiously,     before returns us we atrevimos     to ask them that to continue     in the apartment, but they told us that no,     that these beers had changed owners.</p>   
       <p> When we arrived at the apartment     none of us commented anything on respect,     because it was a bad experience,     since for us it was something insignificant.     If well there had been passing el susto,     we were afraid of being returned to Nicaragua     because it is one of the worst countries     that we had crossed.     For us it was an unnecessary experience.</p>   
       <p>In the morning we prepared to leave the country,     dude to the accord which we made with the police.     At eight in the morning we were in migration office     and we asked for an appointment at two in the afternoon.     We returned to the house to cook and prepared us to leave and     at one we returned to wait for the bus.     It was a special bus,     because in some countries that we cross     migration advised the taxi drivers     to charge us double.     For us it was not a problems     for that which we wanted to be secure.     When we were in the bus it was 1:30 and we lacked     like three persons.     Simply the bus driver does not give it to earn money     to wait for others and when you pay for the ticket     and do not arrive, you lose your money.     We dialogued with the driver, but he did not want to accede.     At least we tried.     Truly for us it was not so important.     For shame one of us that thought selfishly     and to make that what you can with what is around you     to be in order to defend your person and reach your goal.     The others remained and we continued.     We wanted to make a turn     on the page     the most quickly possible     and to continue to leave Honduras,     thus we thought of it well,     it was not so grato to be there.</p>   
       <p>On the moment of the voyage     everyone was joking with impatience     of discovering another land.     In each country that we were going to cross     fortunately we had spoken with a friend,     familiar or known that had passed     for this experience.     Therefore, they explained how should it go,     to whom we should pay, or if we could cross directly.     When we reached the Guatemalan border at dawn,     we followed the instruction     so that nobody would steal our personal items.     We knew beforehand previously that     we would encounter false guides, false taxis,     also that people in the street     who would lie to us desonfiabamos     because they always only wanted to take our money.     A few times we had the luck to not pay.     On this occasion we paid to go     to the migration office,     which was in a market.</p>   
       <p> Like the Cubans they paid     a lot of money     con tal     to cross the border,     the abusive guides made them cross     una colina a hill     to get more money from them,     while with us they allowed us to cross directly.     When we got off the or got on     the taxi that drove us to the border,     the taxi driver told us that there     everyone could cross.     Without thinking much,     in this moment we paid him     five dollars more to the taxi driver     for sharing with us information.     tit is incredible how persons     give so much value to money     and where there is money     it can corrupt whatever,     for more firmly that is to be believed.     Very, but very few people     give anything     without asking anything in return.</p>   
       <p>The van had very strong music     and while recorriamos drove     through the streets of Guatemala     everyone saw us     as if never seen a person of color,     or maybe it was     they saw us with admiration,     I would like to think it was the second.     It was something strange that     on occasions the people     saw us thought that we were Americans     and wanted to speak English to us.     What gave me to think that     I did not have any idea what type of     migration there was going to come at the border.     We observed the van and gave ourselves account     of when the periphery appeared.</p>

       <p>Chapter IX. Guatemala</p>   
       <p>Without stopping</p>   
        <p> Guatemala for us was one of the quickest voyages.     When the conductor of the taxi     left us in front of the immigration offices,     we realized that it was not really the migration office.     Within a public market there was     an office to receive migrants,     in which we obtained a document valid for twenty days,     since we should not stay in the city     more than twenty four hours after obtaining it.</p>   
       <p>While we were waiting for the bus, we looked for a bathroom     to wash our teeth and a restaurant to eat     We were revueltos with the Cubans,     who had also done the outer in a group.     While we alisar,     a woman came to offer us coffee.     It was a religious woman with a big heart     who before giving us food to everyone     and doing with us an oration beautiful and long.     We felt and conversed with her,     did a benediction.     She felt empathy for us,,     but did us to know     that she was conscience     of our suffering     that we were going through.,     we are passing through and will pass through more.     It is extremely rare that     someone puts themselves in our shoes,     nobody had done it this moment.     It is like it was being     observed these humiliations     so that you can cross them overcome them     It is a very beautiful sensation, which it produces you,     to the point that we could not hide our tears.     We were on the point of breaking, as says the Bible,     like a fragile vase.     WE can read in Revelations 21:4     "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away." (New International Version)     Thus ended another episode.     WE estranged ourselves to see     someone showing compassion and acceptance.    </p>   
       <p> She us brindo     her help,     even though she did not have many resources     for that which we felt     very satisfied with the little that she could do.     Very few people have acogido us     until this moment -- in any manner     When could not stay for much time with use;     there was to be very good her company,     so that they stayed with us more time to wait for the bus.     the lady promised that she would return later     if God wanted it.     And also de did each day to help out other groups of migrants,     because they continued coming every morning     around the same time.     But it did not pass more than half day before     that we emprendieramos our route towards Mexico    </p>   
       <p> As soon as the buses arrived,     we formed a line so that they would call our name to take our places     There were three buses that were going to transport around 150 persons.     As soon as all were on the bus, the police     realized a verification,     but it looked like everything was good.     There were some who did not pay and some who at least had enough     money to do it</p>   
       <p>It was not a day in which we did not think     that the authorities or the "coyotes"     would abuse us, because they should not     have come llevado to a terminal of land transport bus terminal;     us same could have bought the tickets,     but this did not have such importance because     already we wanted to leave the country and advance to the next one.</p>   
       <p>The truck finally left on route to reach the capital,     and there we had to take another to arrive at the Mexican border.     We spent a few hours on a short voyage,     we could not rest because the bus     was not very comfortable.</p>   
       <p> During the voyage in the bus, we discussed about the possibility     of living in Mexico and about the option of deportation.     These were things which we thought about all the time.     We could not leave to have those thoughts.     it was impossible to detain the mind of circumstances like that.     Paulo Coelho said     "It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting."( Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist, 23)     Our mind plays the paper fundamental in this journey.     One definitely has responsibility to domar     the thoughts; because it could be provechosos     to maintain a free mind,     bu not in circumstances so difficult and     embarazosas     through which we passed     when there is no domada,     you can lose control and end up crazy.     The same author said that     when someone wants something, they must know     that it care risks and for this     life is worth the pain (FIND QUOTE). It doesn't matter in the end     where i ends, if in the United States or Mexico,     I already feel like a winner with only making     it through alive through some whatever of those two places.     The risk was worth the pain    </p>   
       <p> We arrived at the capital of Guatemala     in the evening,     close to where the migration office was.     WE thought that we were going to be able to sleep     but soon we continued the route     WE only had to realize the transmit     and to print out and     photocopy the necessary document     in order to be there.     Everyone told us that with this paper     we could remain there twenty day s in the country     -- as if one was interested in staying there a second more</p>   
   <p>    For consequence of greeting gracing us    their hospitality    and directing us to the terminal of buses    to buy our tickets.    When we arrived everything was closed.    In Guatemala, he buses    do not have a nocturnal life like in    certain countries we have passed through,    and we could not buy anything    in the last minute we say an ambulant seller who was    selling fritters, but the question is that    she did not want to accept dollars.    We explained to her that we were tourists,    a story that helped to change the idea.    It was not a big thing to eat,    but this us bastaria    for arrive in Mexico</p>
   <p>In how much we should    share with each other repartimos    in order to going to compare our passages    and the seller of tickets wanted to pay for us wanted to charge us    -- he was very abusive --    double the price,    which we did not accept and we told him    that we were waiting    for someone more who told us the normal price    we already hartos    of such abuse of impunity.    The price of the trip was ten dollars    and he wanted to charge us twenty    That which they ignored did not know    is that we had knowledge of those prices,    of almost everything    because those who had passed    had explained to us    step by step their experience,    costs, prices, everything    We were not ignorant of the true cost.    Therefore he,    already gave to us count of    what that    realized that we know the price,    he told us that we should get on the bus.   </p>   
       <p>     For disgrace each country through which     we passed counts with its own armamento of evil;     nos squeaban;     they charge us expensive the food, the water, the taxis,     changing the dollar, physical and verbal abuse, and     above all aun asi,     we could continue our road.    </p>   
        <p>     At five in the morning     we were arriving at the border between Guatemala and Mexico.     On this border the taxis were bicycles with a cabin     which could transport three people maximum.     They said to us that we could not cross without stopping     first for the aduana Mexican to get a visa,     which we had to pass over the river and they knew that     we would not refuse them,     in reality not all of us had a passport.     WE concentrated on the riverbank,     n which we should cross in a balso boat.     unfortunately everything cost in dollars,     something incomprehensible and inexplicable.    </p>

       <p>Hope reborn</p>   
       <p>     Arriving at victory is to pass through     an infinity of tests, fights, falls, deceptions, pain,     nobody can say that you have arrived at victory     if you have not defeated all this first.     We suffer much in the road,     padecimos infinity of afflictions,     disconsolate.     Of equal way, padecimos     injustices, humiliations, alterations, threats, assault,     we pass through the valley of death.     But this now wants to say that     each one of those who arrive in Mexico     are more grateful to God an with life,     because they now here wan say that they are victors.    </p>   
       <p>     It is sad to realize that only     padeciendo     needs that when the human being     begins to invoke god,     it is curious that we need     padecer some type     of anguish     to voltear     towards heaven and cry out for God.     And it is curious because     after what has happened to you     for all those torments and you are now     with work,     in a place where     you sleep and without passing hungry going to bed hungry walking hungry,     you return newly to forget Him.     The human being has much evil within him     and forts to us rapidly     that there exists grace     of this infinite goodness of God    </p>   
       <p>     For us it was convenient     to arrive during the hours of attention,     that is to say,     between 8AM and 12PM.     The taxi brought us to the center of the city,     from there we walked around four kilometers     to arrive at the migration station.     We were lucky that     there were not many people,     only there was us, those of the group    </p>   
       <p>     We realized the travel visa taking the whole day,     but that was what we had to stay in the migration station.     About a month before, migration was deporting all Haitians,     but when we arrived, they were giving permission de estancia for a month.     If you said you were from Congo, they would hold you for at least a month.     After that you orotgaron the visas,     you had to find a place to house yourself,     because the buses with routes from Tapachula to the north     only departed two times a week,     Wednesdays and Saturdays.     We could encounter Jaguars where they were housing us     for two or three dollars a night.     Also there were places which did not cost anything,     but in exchange you had to contract their transport service,     because they had buses that went north,     which cost 120 pesos. (or 120 dollars?)    </p>   
       <p>     We stayed a week to prepare ourselves before the voyage.     Not only to arrive fresh and clean to Tijuana, but also for our families,     they sent us more money.     Above all, we used this time to distract ourselves a bit,     to go out and walk around and to know Tapachula.     Every day it was the same routine,     eat, communicate with the family,     be in waiting during the day of leaving and sleeping.     There were some of the group who had enough money     to follow the road and to continue.     However, the rest gave ourselves     the task to join honey     until each person in the group could take the voyage.     Finally we decided to leave on Saturday at 4PM     Only we had ourselves.     WE had lived together for all those months,     that which we were going to convert into a real family;     watching over each other.     That is, to say, the ultimate empujon     between everyone to arrive in Tijuana     and from there each one to see them cross     to the United States.    </p>   
       <p>     We left in two vans, we were gong with the going     of going to know other places during the voyage.     The voyage lasted four days,     but se ratraso     because one of the vans     the motor failed and     it delayed half a day to repair it.     We arrived in Tijuana in four and a half days.     In the street we communicated     with friends who had already arrived beforehand     in order to know where we were going.     The firs Haitians had arrived in Tijuana in the mohts     of May, June, July, and August     did not have a place to stay and installed themselves in the street,     on the side of a place known as the breakfast shelter of Padre CHava.     The governor of Tijuana never imagined that     entering through his doors such a quantity of foreigners     in such a short time span.     Due to the quantity of Haitians, Africans, Muslims, etc     who were arriving right and left,     there were other organizations     like the religious ones beginning to open,     in equal way the doors for sheltering the quantity of persons     who were sleeping in the street    </p>   
       <p>     There was nothing that we could do,     we came from sleeping in the forest,     were we could have been devoured, bitted,     or died from the attack of a wild animal;     thus to sleep in the public street and     to do our business in it was not a problem.     Int he life of this city     had passed through its streets     an exodus of the black race.     Asimiso was     Tijuana started to change its physiognomy.     We were a barbaridad, uncountable,     According to figures form the Colegio de la Frontera Norte,     to this border arrived between 15,000 and 20,000 Haitians.     The same informed us the media.     And those of us who stayed in Baja California,     in September 2017 was approximately 5000.    </p>   
    <div class="photo">    <figure>     <img src="images/SobrevivSecondHalf-11.jpg"/>     <figcaption>      At the beginning, it was something incredible to see how the migrants      se acosaban      in the street in front of the kitchen of Padre Chava      Each time a migrant arrived in the city,      the first place the taxis would take him was the      Padre Chava      because there was not always a shelter      which was disposed to receive us     </figcaption>    </figure>   
       <p>     Now we knew that Tijuana is one of the cities where more arrive migrants     from different parts of the world     They already know it is used as a point to cross into the United States     or, how happened with us, how we were rooted here    </p>   
       <p>     The first expressions of the Tijuana people     at seeing us on their avenues was of shame,     discontent, discrimination.     It seemed that they had never seen a black person before     If they had seen some in a manner aislada,     but not to many     I I recognized what that asustaba     They think of i well,     if there were in a position     probably you would think the same     I knew that in this moment     We did not have our best aspect.     And not all the Haitians are good people,     just as ntiehr are all the Mexicans.     In this exodus leaving Haiti and Brazil     there were many good and bad people    </p>   
       <p>     WE arrived with a face of extreme tiredness     with a ferocious hunger,     with health problems,     with strong emotional problems     that which anhelabamos was help!     We washed, changed ourselves and     a place where we reted for hours,     more than to eat.     We could not sustain ourselves physically    </p>   
       <p>     Far far away from what we wanted, the reality     constaba of retaking force,     making a line to the side of the     Breakfast kitchen of Padre Chava,     where atinadamente     installed a office of the National Institute of Migration (INM)     in collaboration with the Muniicpa authorities of     Attention tot he Migrant     in charge of ROzario Lozada     who very kindly extended to us     and nos sellaba     to the office of exits of Tapachula,     of whom     indicated the date to cross to the United States.     And a cost put the symbol which could not     according to him clonar     It was already a circle, a star,     a square, a diamond, a trebol,     all of their respective colors,     which could vary.     It was very ingenious of their part,     but the Haitians do not have limits,     they could invent a way to modify everything.     One of the things that we developed unfortunately     in this crossing was the knowledge of how to manipulate the situation and     to put things at our favor.    </p>   
       <p>     The INM looked for a way to organize the     exists     co-jointly with the United Sates government to receive us.     For that which, the INM generally brought groups of     around fifty persons a day.     Also, this same instituio, with the help of Grupo Beta     of the Alejandro Salinas and his work team,     were those who distributed people to the shelters     that were opening in different parts of the city    </p>
       <p>     I connected with a friend     who waited for me in the     Padre Chava Kitchen     and from there he directed me to a street     camed Scorpion Canyon     ,     just where is located     Templo Embajadores de Jesús     (Embassador of Jesus Temple)     Sincerely,     already I was desperate     and I did not want to enter in hope     with the assignations and distribution of     groups in order to arrive at a shelter.     In Templo Embajadores de Jesús     -- run by pastor Gustavo Banda Aceves and his wife Zaida Guíllén López-     equal to the other places,     noted you on a list which conformed     to going to arrive and that is how we were going to go.     They gave priority to women wth children     and to pregnant women and to sick people     so that they going to beforehand    </p>   
       <p>     The numbers they used were not only     to have the count of persons     who they were receiving,     also it served to facility with coordination     with INM with the end     of bringing these people to the     garita (border gate?)     so that groups could form easily     with the assignation of numbers.     In this manner, migrant persons     did ot have to make a line     so that they would give them a date.     I have remembered storied counted     that there arrived     to go almost thirty each day     and most of those who crossed     achieved to arrive at their destination in the United States,     that in the most part it was Florida,     a blace where they arrived with a relative or friend.     Those who did not have the Providence     made contact with some Haitian Pastor     who could receive them.    </p>   
       <p>     Templo Embajadores de Jesús     is a church;     nevertheless however,     before this emergency situation     it was converted into a refuge,     for which it functioned in the two ways.    </p>   
       <p>     It was the biggest refuge,     it could shelter up to 600 persons.     NO other place had this capacity.     The members of this church,     especially the Ortega family,     were those who were there day after day,     distributed the places,     proportioned cobijas,     personal items,     repartiendo giving out     clothes, food, etc.    </p>   
       <p>    </p>   
       <p>     The treatment was different, human,     respectful, comprehensive,     something we had not seen in     any other place,     except the woman who felt empathetic     towards us     in one of our trajectories travels journeys.     Here they received people at any hour,     whether if it was in the morning, in the evening     or at dawn.     The door was never closed.     But since the door never closed,     many Haitians who recien,     came to ignore it,     because that there were many     families who arrived at 2, 3, 4AM     and who remained outside waiting in the cold     until amaneciera     and offered them a place.     Complete families.     It was something truly impresionante.    </p>   
       <p>     IN all places where there are an infinity of rules,     but here there were not apparently any.     All the others had a schedule to     wake up, eat, shower, exit, enter; here no.     There were two places very regulated;     in one of those at 5 in the morning     te sacaban     with the cold they make,     no matter that there are women with children or pregnant women.     This is the norm.     Also, properly it is not a shelter;     it gives you breakfast     and you have to wander around the city     until 4 or 5 in the afternoon,     when they return you to give entrance     if it is alcanzabas place.     There are others which are all men,     where the same     te sacaban     at five in the morning     and at six in the afternoon     you have to be returning,     to mention a few examples.     It is understandable: those are its norms     and we have to respect them    </p>   
       <p>     However, in Templo Embajadores de Jesús,     this did not exist.     You could enter at the hour you wanted,     but at nine they turned off the lights     and everybody went to bed.     This was the first months because     the pastor and his wife worked,     therefore also they had to rest a bit.     TO say in some way,     the workday     was continuous and interminable,     because if someone needed something     in the madrugada     -- which was very common --     they had to attend to them.     For that which needed     to have a time of rest.     As indicated by the hour     for sleep,     the pastor sung a song, with which     he gave us to understand that     still we had to     apagar     everything;     it said more or less this:     "Until morning, if God wishes,     that you sleep well,     the hour will come to     acostarse go to bed     and to sleep as well     because tomorrow will     be another day and you     have to live it joyfully"     It was something unusual and very     chistoso.     We laughed at it.     Despite that which it was put very strict with people,     resulted to have     its ratos crazy.    </p>   
       <p>     Nevertheless, it put me to a bad luck     when I arrived and there was no space.     The pastor indicated told us to various     that there could not so many     and they had to send us to another place,     for that which was referred to us with the INM,     that which could only bring us to the street in front     of Padre Chava. This was around eight at night and,     thus to your luck,     you had to look for what you could,     in a hotel or another shelter.     They put me in contact with a friend     who was staying close to the linea,     where there were spaces on beds to spend the evening.    </p>   
       <p>     Scorpion Canyon,     Iglesia Embajadores de Jesús     ,     a shelter which received almost     half of the Haitians migrants for more than six moths.     The church had more than 500 Haitians,     between men, women, children;     everyone was interested in     arriving there     because it was the only shelter in which     migration ordered from ten to thirty persons a day,     that is to say that each day arrived     more people than left.     There was always food and it was easy to obtain it,     but on occasions the pop;el passed more than four hours     in the bathroom line,     before which Pastor Gustavo and his loving wife     -- who are considered as the protectors and parents     of the Haitians, especially by me,     enlarged the bathroom to allow the use of the migrants.     Still there were hundreds of persons in this shelter,     to such a point that the church     initiated a project towards the end     of 2016,     which called Little Haiti.    </p>   
       <p>    </p>   
       <p>     But as I am a man necio and insistent,     despite not having been accepted in the Temple,     returned the next day early in order to look a new     for a space for myself.     I knew that in this place the popel     go early and reach their destiny (destination)     God was there,     because many who were in the church     arrived with their family members or friends.     Of such luck that insisted and I stayed.     Also I furthermore     was procuring to be with my friend,     who I had already met in this place,     because we wanted to try to enter together.     The idea was to cross and go to the house of my mother     who for various years lived in Florida.    </p>   
       <p>     My arrival in Tijuana was the 8 of December of 2105.     November and December, you could say,     were the months, in which it was more easy to     inter the United States without being deported.     It was like a grace period.     This is what passed by Obama,     surely because before this it had bee there was declared     as the United States president     that more deportations he had done.     TO much the Haitians benefit ted them     this change so repenting,     for what which he gave us access to this nation.    </p>
       <p>     Some authorities asked sobornos;     they started with 200 dollars     and in the end they eny ended charging 400.     who they were,     thus paid them     in order to enter before the assigned date.     Many, without knowing it,     were paying for their deportation.     Over all what happened in the months of September and October.     In fact, also they did their labor with "coyotes"     and I could not mention some quantity,     but effectively there were Haitians who took this route;     they did not have luck.     They charged the charges were     five thousand and seven thousand dollars.     Half here, half crossed    </p>   
       <p>     TO those who waited came their turn to present themselves     in the Migration office United states,     waited a week, two weeks,     or up to a month     to make the decision to allow them to enter     the United States or to be deported to Haiti.    </p>   
       <p>     From the moment that we arrived in Tijuana,     the agents of INM explained to us     that they could not give us papers     to remain in Mexico.     In reality it was not the objective     that we were persecuted.     Some Haitians thought     that the helters     received a lot of money     from the government to help out the migrants,     and that for this they were not convinced     athat they did not leave those places.     For us, they were being benefited     thanks to the public the city.     WE spoke and thought that the Mexicans who     we stayed in the city     to have black people in it.    </p>   
       <p>     Surely , like in all places, various shelters     benefited from the part of each government     had for these asuntos affairs.     But not all.     We discovered that in other places the pastors of other churches     that were objen     were charging 200 pesos (12 dollars) a night.     They said that it was not certain,     but if it was.     We ourselves knew ,     we had conocidos knowledge     of all the places     and we communicated constantly.     Now that I think of it, it is logical,     that we did not have resources like established places     to attend to the migrant.     In some form we should cover the     expenses that the Haitians generate.     I can understand it.    </p>   
       <p>     In the Temple where we were     there was not type of charge;     it was a church established as a refuge,     where the faith of the pastors was to     come to the sustenance of such people.     It was a refuge, we said of emergency,     due to they had the form     to give us a place to sleep.     After we discovered that the pastors     counted with a foundation ,     Sfama Fundación Regalando Amor, A. C.     However, its statues did not say "migrants",     only help to the families     disintegrated     and the children of the street.     Even so, through medio of this foundation     was that came to help the government     but not with the same place came     to the places the attention of the migrants.    </p>   
       <p>     The paid for the necessities of food,     cobijas, colcconetas,     water and daily medicines very opportune.     In the time, they assisted an infinity of altruistic groups     who hape to support, like Border Angels,     run by de Hugo. Castro and Gaba Cortés,     who are the most well known.     Agradezco     the Tijuanese community     because they formed solidarity with us     aportando     all kids of living things,     clothes, etc.     I had the impression to see like three days during those months     came the benedictions of God in that place,     the food was abundant,     this was one of the things that more fascinated me, obviously.     Asimismo also i touched to see the collaboration     with the World Organiztion of Migration (OIM),     run by  Christopher Gascón.     They proportioned to this church     tables, seats, pots of all times to cook,     knives, and a zinc industrial     for the power to feed to same people.     Truly it was a valiant aid.    </p>   
       <p>     from afar, the aid proportioned by     Attention to the Immigrant,     an office of the Social Municipal Development (SEDESON),     the Methodist Church of San Diego,     run by Pastor Elise,     the Foundation Siloe de la MIssion,     groups of Korean doctors from San Diego,     a n anonymous altruistic person who lvied in San Diego,     and above all the community of Tijuana.    </p>   
       <p>     They helped with our auxilio     different churches in the neighborhood     without importing the religion.     There lived Adventists, Baptists,     Presbyterians, Catholics,     and until the atheists     participated in its valiant collaboration.     It was an incredible experience.     After I time, I joined another institution     named Espacio Migrante (Migrant Space),     run by Paulina Oivera Cáñez,     who put to work of looking for help of lawyers     not only of the city but also in the United states.     These helped us with discussions about our rights in Mexico     thus already they were seeing that difficultly     all could cross and that many remained atorados     in this country.     They shared this information very important to the Haitian people.     I want to mention all who were involved in this labor so unimaginable labor,     but I do not remember the names of all.    </p>   
       <p>     Someone that called much attention was the labor     that a young man named Terry did and two of his friends;     they gave the task to fill the church with     colchones     for everyone.     They came from Santa Monica, California --     if bad I don't remember     How can they for cubrir     this necessities,     who throws away so many good     colchones     that dodes not allow them to pass the cold?     His labor was very notable and I feel     infinite gratitude for it.     He shared with us comodidad and rest.    </p>   
       <p>     Since with all this, many Haitians     began to desesperar     before the expectation     of having an opportunity to enter the United States.     In the temple at times every     left control with the leavings;     it was difficult to control so many people     and everyone wanted to go,     since they did not touch the turns.     At times we calmed down, sometimes no.    </p>   
       <p>     The INM already knew the entrance to the United States     for the Haitians was going to be complicated and there were     so many the number of deported;     for that which had the sense that they     presented us the option     -- just in this moment --     to let us stay there with a Humanitarian visa.     This option was not was there was desired,     but it was what we had on the table to take.     Some - to look a the things that take themselves difficult,     after having suffered so much,     took the inexplicable decision     to be returned to Brazil or Haiti,     for which the government facilitated the things     for their voyage    </p>   
       <p>     Others like myself made dediced     to remain ourselves in Tijuana.     It was not an easy decision,     especially for the force strength and support     which we had brindado our family members     to realize this voyage     with the end     to arrive our families rooted in the United Staes,     with the expectation that     already we would be there     recompensing them with our work.     The majority acquired debts in Haiti     with the bak, with their friends,     with their relatives,     or sold the little they had with as much as     to pursue the "American Dream".     What a false illusion.     After all this, to return was not just.    </p>   
       <p>     In the end I can say     that it was a decision that God took,     that which in comparison with all that     awaited us in the United states, was better.     I have friends who still remain prisoners in     some prison in the United States,     awaiting deportation,     and others that I have met in Haiti.     Sadly a great part of them do not live in Haiti.     Some don't only have relatives there.     They have been criados     in Brazil, in the Dominican Republic, or in Chile;     I do not want to even imagine the triple     suffering of those who live there,     in a country they do not known,     sep where and sep with whom.     The first suffering was caused by leaving their place of origin     and leaving everytingin     to apostar to the nothing;     the second, to come to a border city,     not knowing anyone     and looking their supervivencia;     and the third,     to spend months in the jail     without being delinquents;     only for the simple fact of wanting     to have a better live;     living with real criminals     and padecer     newly cold and hunger.    </p>   
       <p>     In my case, I had the hope of being able to earn more money     than what I earned in Brazil.     That paid per month approximately 1300 *reales*,     which would be about 30 dollars.     but I discovered that here in Mexico     it paid every week or bimonthly, marvelous.     I realized that here in Mexico money is not that important;     you can eat well with little money.     You can work and rest in the afternoon or     work in the night     and sleep in the morning.     IN United States it does not have the peace     which has touched me to live in Mexico.     I know that there are people who should have     up to three jobs for the power to sustain themselves.     Furthermore, there is not here     the racism the same grade     as in the United States,     we all feel the respect from most people.     I appreciated the ventaja     of what here,     to see that do not cross us and this     is not is not an option,     we encounter the form of work without papers     and without problems anyone.    </p>   
       <p>     at the end of January 10 2017,     i still could not enter the United States.     Only pregnant women and those with children     had possibilities,     and , even so,     many were deported,     sadly some     a escasos     days     de parir     and ended up pariende     in Haiti.     So they remaied was the only option real     to almost 5000 Haitian persons     who were living in Baja California.     Actually , the number cifra     had diminished because many solicited     their return;     according to the information     which the INM shared with me,     tentatively there are here between 2500 and 3000.    </p>   
        <p>     Afterword    </p>    <p>     My perception of the borders    </p>   
       <p>     Brazil    </p>   
       <p>     We knew that, everywhere in the world,     the commerical frontire     is one of the economic forces that each country     shares with its neighbor,     but some of those can not     benefit from this opportunity     for lack of production.     THis is the case in the Americas,     generator of poverty in many countries!    </p>   
       <p>     THe majority of the countris of the Americans are connected     by their borders,     nevertheless tht does not impede     having great economic deficiencies    </p>   
       <p>     To start this stude     i crossed several countries     and took the time to see what     some interchanges are realized in particular ways     Here, zBrazil is the only country     which shares a border with France     towards its departmento of Guyana.     THe only two countries of SOuth America     whcih do not share a border with Brazil     are Ecuador and CHile    </p>   
       <p>     I have not been able to see all the borders shared with Brazil,     but I realized a visual study of the commercial border     between BOlivia and Brazil.     Those countries have importations     very differnt in SOuth America.     Brazil is the most powerful distributor     of agriculture in this reagion and     BOlivia is one of the poorest coutnries     in SOuth America.     This border has vuelto     each time more insecure due to     the interchange of cocain which is     realzied the distributor of the stated states.     But clearly Brazil always has had     its way to progress due to its     cria a ganado     and agriculture,     tht are interchanges very powerful between them.     Howeve,r this interchange seems more or less singular     becuause BOlive has almost nothing to offer Brazil,     except immigrans.     cción.     Este es el caso en las Américas, ¡-generando pobre  Brazil is also known as a country     which opens its doors and     gives welcome to immigrants,     the same form is considered a superpower.     Despite its fall in the WOrld CUp,     Brazil remains being the leader of South America    </p>   
       <p>     THe broder between Brazil and Peru es one of the most peacheful     borders because commerce does no have a place     in the same way as in GUyana (province of the metropoli French).     Between Brazil and Pero,     there are less drugs.     Peruvaians use this border     to enter and work     because in Brazil the work is more easy     if you buy with the countries of SOuth America     Brazil is a place where     whomever can conseguir get papers rapily and easily.    </p>   
       <p>Peru - Ecuador</p>   
       <p>In the border between Peru and Ecuaor,     the economic atmosphere is maenjada managed     by a very active marke.     In almost every border studied,     unfortunately,     prostitution is one of the     oficios     more spread out.     It is well known.    </p>
       <p>     Both countries have different currencies,     the Ecuador maneja the     US dollar, which still empuja     an interchange very big with Pero.     This, no doubt,     in a way of paso     for the narcotraffickers and the human traffikcers     who have made some more easy for     the immigrants of Brazil, Venezuela and CHile     to cross the border.    </p>   
       <p>     Ecuador - Colombia    </p>   
       <p>     COlumbia is known as one of the principal producors     countries that produce the world's cocaine.     In its border shared with Ecuador, for example,     they use the mountains near the border to transport     whateve type of illegal thing.     THe migrants know that some of themse streets     because not all can go directly,     thus you have     encrujiadas to dare.     The houses there have an alarm stystem.     Of waht luck tht the delinquency on the border     is more popular than peace.    </p>   
       <p>     Columbia - Panama    </p>   
       <p>     In fact, there is no border between Colombia and Panama,     between them is he forest named Darien Gap, which has the     promedio     most high of traffickers who circulate their trugs.     IN general these two contries do not share love betwen them     adn it is only the pasage posbile to     travel from Columbia and Panama,     is by air,     because there is no other road way     to recorrer,     at least if yu decide to cross the forest     which has some 160 km in length.     THe immigrants use this dangerous road and to enter     el suelo     of Panama     (more details in the book)    </p>   
       <p>     Panama - Costa Rica    </p>   
       <p>     At the length of all the borders,     drugs are badly controlled     by the authorities     because the young are more intelligent than them.     In the border between Panama and Costa Rica,     the sale of marijuana is very popualr.     GIve more work to the police, no matter,     as are some of the controdcutions     contradiction of peace     rules in all bordrs    </p>   
       <p>     THe populations of both terrirories are capable     of transiting and returning without any problem,     which facilitats more the vast circulation of drugs.     This, which results beign vary favorable     for all types of people without scruples who enter and exit     at their antojo    </p>   
       <p>     Costa Rica - Nicaragua    </p>   
       <p>     Unfortunately the least agreealbel place, the people are not very nice.     THe base of the border is the     aduana,     becasue Costa Rica is not involved in any type of relation with its neighbor     in form of a marked,     as is seen in otther porters.     For the Nicaraguan it is obligatory     to cross     el suelo     costarican     with a visa,     because these two countries do not have the same     economic level.     Here things     se manejan     of other way,     the Nicaraguans who live in Csota Rica     have tohave a residenty card.     If not they will be deported.     It's that easy.    </p>   
       <p>     THe only commerce permitted is that which does not need documents in the market, prostitution    </p>   
       <p>     Nicaragua-Hodnduras    </p>   
       <p>     No one can describe the sitation of the border     between NIcaragua and Honduras,     due to the way of crossing to Nicaraua     Very few know come is the reality on the border,     becsuase it is one of the territories which has not     been analyized,     not only because it is illegal to corss it,     but also they do not accept that the immigrants put     pie en sus suelos     only because it is illegal to corss it,     without having a visa.    </p>   
       <p>     HOnduras - Guatemalla    </p>   
       <p>     It is the most calm border we crossed becasue the commercial activity     is extreely weak in comparison     with other frontiers whcih we were able to cross.     The principla activity was not to analyze the borders,     but I -- as I am very observer --     took it as a part of my expereince     from the bieginning to the end,     each small detail mattered.    </p>   
   <p>Guatemala - Mexico</p>
       <p>     Mexico is the first country in North America     when it arrives     through Central America.     Guatemala is very open with Mexico --     if one take in account how was the process to cross the border --     but the activities economics of the two countryies     compart     a very rich commercial frontier,     above all in coffe.     THere are not grand novelties in comparison     with other borders     which we have crossed,     they are alsomt the same,     but at a larger scale.    </p>   
       <p>     Mexico - United Sttes    </p>   
       <p>     The border between the United States and Mexico     abaarcaa around 3200 kilometers (CONVERT     and extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.     Baptised as "the tortilla border", it isthe most transitted     broder in the world, with 181 million persions who cross around     of all the border shared with the United States of America (2015)    </p>   
       <p>     However, during 2016 and 2017 the immigrants took routes     in order to cross Baja California,     that which facilitated them to reach their destination.     THis fact gives us more time to do a fuller study of borders,     particularly of TIjuana    </p>   
       <p>     THis city plays a very importan paper in the Mexican exonomy.     It is one of the cities most search for by the imigrants;     it is easy to get theher.     Sex and drugs, the reason why people from the Unnited Stats     frequent it a lot,     as well as its rich gastronomy and culture.    </p>   
       <p>     Delingquancy in thsi region is stronger than the armed forces,     but it does not impete that the popualtion is content.     THe heart of the city is REvolutcion Street of the happy TIjuana.     THe artisans and artists a rol very transcendent in order     the image of the city.     THe economy of this border is dynamic,     it could be said apacibe     but effective.    </p>   
       <p>     Reality    </p>   
       <p>     I ask myself sometimes:     who has the truly truth?     Deahth, the devil, sickness,     or a fracaso?     we know that there is not we should not     proccupy ourselves worry about     the fracasos,     but ttheer are the disproved opportunities.     In life one has two options     and the two are acceptable:     to assume responsility for our life     and to do the most with our possibilityies     to the end of     cazar     the obsurity or     leave it alson, guided by your own will,     with which you never will remain in opscurity.     Because one     pez     in a     pozo     can not know the ocean    </p>   
       <p>     Do not admit that your misery     is already written,     that this iss your destiny;     our destiny lo     escogemos     each one.     We have a pencil and an erasor,     and we have to know how to use them     for the most just causes,     but they are not there everyday.     Everone has to make sacrifices     in life because of money,     sacrifices that we would never do     for love.     Learn that we are humans,     that we have a heart     and only there is     colocar     our hands around it in order to feel     un latido     says you that you are alive.     Your heart is your home,     of which to leave it you will leave it     the entrance of the love of GOd,     who lives there     and replaces the hatred and the deveil.     One elects everyday what is     the best, good and just.     before clieaning our hearts for the power to see     all the riches that we have, the prosperity, the future,     and our dreams.    </p>   
       <p>     LEave to see with neversvousness the places where you can see,     control your     entorno and concentrate on the opportunities,     Realize, one after the other,     and allow that your will and your interior peace     takes good decidsion.     Do not say that you do not have time suffficient,     which is the better is acortar,     taka a rapid alternative. Do not give to the pieople who think for you,     take your own descicions,     GIve it your importance on each minor detain,     because if not you pay     major consequences.     You should encounter     suffienct patieantce and perseverance.     P.L.U.R.:     Patience, Love, Union, and Respect.     And do not be a slave to your own objectives     try always to have a plan B.     DO not abandon for which you have     done a struggle only do not come out all     of what you want or hope for.    </p>   
       <p>     Above all, things do not depend on one person     nor on the money;     your happiness depends on the love that you have in your heart.     Learn to have confidence in yourself     and truly all can be realized,     that is the same that feeds you.    </p>
