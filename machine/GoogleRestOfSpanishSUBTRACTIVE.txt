 <div> <p> I wonder sometimes: what do we really fear? To die, to hell, to illness or to failure? We know that you don't have to worry about failures, but about missed opportunities. In life one has two options and both are acceptable: to assume responsibility for our life and do our best with our possibilities in order to hunt the darkness; or leave you guide-by your own will, with which you will never stay in the dark. Because a fish inside a well cannot know the ocean. ■ </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Do not admit that your misery is already written, that this is your destiny; Our destiny is chosen by each one. We have a pencil and an eraser, and we have to know how to use them for fairer causes, but they won't be there every day. We have all made sacrifices in life because of money, sacrifices we never make for love. Learn that we are human, that we have a heart and that we just have to place our hands. on top of him to feel a beat that tells you that you are alive. That heart is your home, to which you will cease to enter the love of God, who will dwell there and replace hate and the devil. One chooses every day what is best, good and fair. Simply clean our heart to see all the riches we have, prosperity, future and our dreams. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Stop looking anxiously at the places you can see, control your surroundings and focus on the opportunities. Realize them, one after another, and let your will and your inner peace make good decisions. Do not say that you do not have enough time, that it is best to shorten, take a quick alternative. Don't let people think for you, make your own decisions. Give importance to every minor detail, so you don't pay major consequences. You must find enough patience and perseverance. P. A. U. R: Patience, Love, Union, and Respect. And don't be a slave to your own goals; Always try to have a plan B. Do not give up what you have fought for just because everything did not go as you wanted or expected. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> After all, things don't depend on a person or money; Your happiness depends on the love you have in your heart. Learn to be confident in yourself and you will see that everything you can do, since that will feed you. </p> </div>
