When people dropped their backpacks or suitcases, they less stopped. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Another way to travel was by land in a trailer that passed through customs. The drivers did it when they met someone they knew working in customs. It was a way to get to Honduras faster. Every night there were people waiting for a driver to help them continue. Sometimes they did, but there were also traps, because the thieves were on the prowl. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Chapter VII. Nicaragua </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Forbidden Land </p> </div>

<div> <p> Nicaragua is the only country that cannot be crossed despite having diplomatic relations with Haiti. All the power of that country depends on its president. Because of the migrants, Nicaraguan soldiers have jobs every day. The first time I arrived in that land was with a group of Cubans. These types of trips have their own name. We called it via, derived from the word travel in Spanish. Cubans do not travel frequently with Haitians because they have their own contacts and in fact each nation has its own travel style. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> I must make a parenthesis to explain that there was a Senegalese. They were brave; he had crossed all Nicaragua on foot, he was very smart in his journey, because in each strategic place he had marked and left a sign thinking - of course - that there could be a possibility of being returned. No doubt he was willing to try again if, upon arriving in Honduras, he was returned to Costa Rica. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> When he was effectively returned, he took all the other Africans and they took the same path. No Haitian had that degree of courage. The "coyote" that happened to us asked us to be brave and that, if we were not, then we would be because we were going to need it, since he would be waiting for us in Honduras, at the other end of Nicaragua, where he would charge us half of payment. The other half would be sent to a friend, who would wait for our notice that we had already done our part and we would pay him the other half. The "coyote" told us that we would leave in about four hours. It had taken us days to get to Panama, so those four hours felt like a fraction of a second. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> He introduced us to three guides to cross-two police bases and so that they could take us to a free place. In the group there were two babies and that caused us concern because it is very easy to be located with the crying of a baby, because the soldiers were never far away in case anyone started crying. That definitely increased nervousness and adrenaline. Since we started walking, we felt closer to Honduras. After about an hour of being underway, we arrived at a point very close to the soldiers, but fortunately they did not see us. Two of them appeared on a motorcycle, and we all immediately fell to the ground. It is difficult to describe the heaviness that can be felt in these circumstances, the breathing agitated by fear and insecurity that we live in those moments. Only who lives these circumstances can understand it. I don't think you can imagine the risk we take every day. There are so many dangers in these paths that we go through hunger, thirst, ailments, insect bites and extreme physical exhaustion. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We were on the road for almost six hours! And we never got to the place where we should and the worst thing is that there was no sign. Of course we were all more than worried. We arrived at a point where there was a change of guides. They told us - I want to think that in order not to be frightened - that all this was part of the plan, that we should continue with the new guides, who would lead us to the connection. Connection means the second part of the road. The Cubans did not want to change the guide, but we were forced to take it because we could not stay in the jungle. We continue our route until night falls. Fear, despair and the desire to see another day grew in our hearts. There were times when every time one had to cross a cornfield, everyone ran, until they reached an iron wire, but sometimes those iron wires were powered by electric current. And if for some strange reason someone did not have the time to escape, they would have to go out and transfer the wires, which would be a very expensive payment for traveling; in addition to greatly risking his life. </p> </div>

<div> <p> After crossing so many fields, we rest in the afternoon; not even two minutes had passed when thieves attacked us, it turned out that these thieves were the first three guides! In the act we realized that they were because they had not changed the shirts, they only had scarves that covered their faces and the thinnest was the easiest to distinguish. The point was that they were "armed to the teeth," with a variety of weapons that included a 9mm, knives and machetes. Two of them were in front, us in the middle and the other behind us. These unscrupulous people used their tactics to sculpt us. Unfortunately they don't know respect for anyone, since they didn't have compassion with women either. With all the carelessness and without looking at it, they removed their pants and put their hands inside the shorts. They wanted everything! They didn't care at the cost of what. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> There are thieves and rapists who take as they please any person who crosses their path. Everything that happened was planned; the other guides stepped aside, and told us that if someone followed them, that person would die. Of course, we didn't even try to follow them. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The Cubans got too angry, because '' it was not the first time this happened to them; They had already lost almost everything, just like most. The night was approaching and with it the rain, we had no place to protect children. It was a night too cold and hard to bear, but we did it once more. We truly feel that God saved us that night. It can be said that we rest peacefully, because previously we had walked long before reaching the connection. To continue, the guides asked us to take care of our money; surely we were going to give them. Of course not! Now more than ever, we were not confident, his words were pure lies. In this medium, one should never trust anyone. It is impossible. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The human being is so cruel, so bad; pure people without a heart, blinded by their own benefit, somewhat depressing. His justification for keeping the money was supposedly defending him from other assailants, as they would be the only ones not to be sculpted. What they wanted to take care of us, if we didn't have anything anymore! So we let them know exactly that, we were without a penny. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> When we got there, we asked them to talk on the phone with the person with whom we had hired the trip, to explain what was happening, but he refused. He didn't want to talk to us; He said that part of the money was missing to make the connection *. We tried to convince him that we would pay him when he arrived, but the guides didn't want to keep talking to us. They told us that it would be better to leave a message and that they would pass it on. The trip contractor was a thief and was hinting that the Haitians had not paid, even though the Cubans had sent him a message telling him that they would pay what was missing. •. . •> </p> </div>

<div> <p> We were forced to go on our own. We were very close to the road and we noticed that there was traffic and someone could see us. Some policemen passed by. After waiting three to four hours, the truck that had to make the connection never arrived and it was past four in the afternoon. Everyone began to worry about not being able to take the trip and having to spend another night in the jungle. No one had seen where the guides had gone and suddenly a police car arrived. The Cubans realized they ran. In fact we all ran except the women who had babies. It happened that a Haitian friend and a Cuban ran, the police followed them and we no longer knew about them, we lost track of them. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> You could say that the road had already gone wrong. . Then we had to try to get out and see what the new strategy was going to do. Although we wanted to stay in a group, a part withdrew, possibly when the police arrived. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We left for the road, some of us went to bed and two Cubans made signs to the cars on the road to try to ask them for a ride that would bring us closer to the Honduran border, but in reality we were only two hours from Costa Rica . Every time we saw a car we were afraid of being returned to Costa Rica. We ran the risk of losing our money and our trip and having to do it completely again, because most of the people who organize the road are thieves. When we started walking, an armed forces car took us by surprise. They told us that we shouldn't worry, keep calm. When we spent the night, we would be back in Costa Rica in the morning. As soon as we arrived at their base, we saw the rest of the group that had left another way. Then the Red Cross fed us and used clothes. We were disappointed that we couldn't get to Honduras, but also happy that we would not spend another day in the jungle. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Each one had a mat on the floor and we drank the same water from a well from which the soldiers drank. And we made a hole to go to the bathroom, which we shared with the soldiers because there was no bathroom with drainage. It was a Nicaraguan military base; The next morning we were en route to Costa Rica with the soldiers who agreed to us. As soon as we arrived, we went to the address provided by the person who had organized that route, but to! Denying his house we saw no one, not even his dog. We could not go to the police because such trips were not authorized. It was a decision we made on our own and we had to take responsibility for it. Each time we denounced a travel guide, he was arrested only to calm the group, but then he was released and kept his money. There are some evildoers who pay people to monitor us. Our only hope is that we will all be accountable to the court of justice at the end of our days. </p> </div>

<div> <p> Thank God the cell phones had not been stolen, only mine. People took me for crazy because I was the one who had invited them to travel with that man and I didn't have a penny. I would have to find another way out of Costa Rica with those people to regain my peace of mind. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The same day I started my failed trip there was a friend who invited me to travel with him inside a container; I rejected it because I trusted my original plan, but mine had failed and his had succeeded. This friend put me in touch with the same truck driver to try to convince him to organize another trip. I was afraid because I knew in advance that some people had died in those boxes, but this driver was different. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The container had a large hole under the truck in order for the air to enter, and my job was to gather around thirty people. If we gathered people together, I and my friends could travel for free. But 'imagine! Who would have confidence in you immediately after having organized a failed trip? Non-obvious, they also knew that the driver was always successful on his trips and our trip was scheduled for Sunday. ■ </p> </div>

 <div> <p> As for me, I gathered more than forty people for Sunday's departure. Everyone was impatient, but the driver called us and told us that he could not that Sunday and had to wait for the next. I could not make any kind of claim because I had an empty pocket, but some who no longer had patience took another route; some successfully and others not; and when they returned they said: "Yes, I knew, I should have waited for me." </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The days passed super slow and we had little patience. In fact, we were full of impatience, of discontent; because it seemed that nothing was going well. When Sunday finally arrived, I didn't even have time to eat because I focused on bringing together the people on the list and others that I had added. At our meeting point, near a gas station, I had to collect the money and pay half of the total for everyone, and the rest when we arrived. My important things were inside a suitcase with the driver. </p> </div>

<div> <p> There were people who threatened me if we returned, telling me they would beat me. But my team and I talked often about the chances of that happening if we didn't succeed. We organized step by step, cautiously. The driver did not work alone, there was another driver with him as a backup and some guides, because we had to cross a lake on foot and that would take about four hours. We start the road at 4:00 p. m. I noticed that the guides had firearms, if necessary. That time I felt that everything would be fine. On this occasion, oddly enough, I felt ■ certain that everything would be fine and that there would be no problems. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Every day would be the same tasks. One had to walk for hours before making the connection, passing the electrified iron wires and other things. We spent the night in the house of one of the guides to hydrate before changing with another group of guides, who were part of the plan. We made the change in the middle of nowhere. We listened only to the birds and the wind pinking the branches of the trees. Sometimes we ask ourselves why we made so many sacrifices, but we already know the answer. We are human and isolation is stronger than us. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> After many hours of walking in the middle of the jungle we were reaching the connection point. When they gave us the indication of getting into the container we ran like crazy, we hit each other. Once everyone was inside the container, the driver provided everyone with water for the trip. We had to remain silent until we arrived in Honduras. The trip was faster than we thought, because we left at eight in the evening and arrived at four in the morning. The experience in the container was wonderful because we didn't see anything. of the outside. You can say it was a sense of relief. We just had to wait for the driver to give us the signal to get off. And when we get off, we walk about an hour before crossing the Nicaraguan border to reach Honduras. Blessed God, we had succeeded. All went well. In spite of all the sorrows we had on the road, in the end God showed us a way out. Hallelujah! </p> </div>

 <div> <p> After months of misery going through the jungle, suffering physically and emotionally, we never hope to get to Honduras. All this really was a test of survival and thank God we floated. Some said that the road began in Honduras, because there were only two countries, Guatemala and Mexico, to reach our destination, which was the United States of America. Honduras was one of the countries that accepted Haitians without problem, while in Panama we had to say that we were Africans. In Honduras they knew well that we were Haitians, that we came from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela and other places. When we get there, we get dirty, tired and hungry. The only thing we wanted immensely was to first bathe, eat and rest; Most of us didn't have clothes. It was very nice to see how we all shared what we had. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> It was different groups that arrived. Some groups had spent many days in Nicaragua before arriving in Honduras, but we, thank God we only stayed one night. At eight o'clock in the morning we had to notify the migration offices that we were in the country. That allowed us to be entitled to an appointment for which we had to wait two or three days, depending, in order to have the paper! that would allow us to cross the country. The same day you sign that paper, you promise to leave the country. Because of this, many Haitians stayed in that place because they had no money to pay for the travel ticket. Then they decided not to sign. Without a doubt, we felt closer to the goal and more calmly. You could even say that we wanted to continue the adventure because in Honduras we had no pressure, everything was calm. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Chapter VIII. Honduras </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Imminent victory </p> </div>

<div> <p> In Honduras we could rent a hotel, but we preferred to rent an apartment room, because in a hotel we couldn't cook and we didn't have much money. We weren't looking for comfort, but to meet a basic need. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We knew in advance that we should not waste any more time; Everything had to be planned correctly, as we had done since we left Brazil. The reason for our urgency was that President Obama's period was about to end soon. We were aware of the news, of the political struggle for power that was being lived in the United States. We mistakenly think that being this president would give us political asylum without problem and open the doors for our benefit. Nothing is further from reality, because the benefit was not for everyone. Obama was one of the presidents who made the most deportations during his term. At that time, the elections between the two candidates were very close and we knew their political tendencies. They knew that if Donald Trump won things would not be in our favor. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Arriving at! apartment that we rented, we took a bath and saw how to move to buy food. Until that time we were six Haitians. I had no cell phone thanks to thieves who left me incommunicado. I had to buy one in order to be in ■ contact with my mother, who cared about me. But first / we had to change, because we already had time with the same clothes and we needed to go buy something new. However, despite what we planned to do, we relaxed for a few minutes, drank some beers and listened to music. We talked about our experiences in. this months. By that time we had. 'already three months of travel. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> There was talk of going for a walk, dancing, meeting people and having fun; but since we were so tired and the night was very long, we fell asleep. '</p> </div>

 <div> <p> In the morning, when we woke up we had to go in search of a Haitian who had more time there, because for some reason he stayed in the country. His data had been passed to us, since many who had crossed knew it. He was the only one who could explain to us how the situation was in the migration offices. We felt some anxiety and we didn't want to waste time, but we didn't want to go too fast either. Some Haitians who arrived a week before we were taken to a place to buy cheap clothes and cell phones. I wanted to talk to my mom because that day was her birthday, on November 28. For this I got $ 500 organizing a trip. I managed to integrate a group to buy the cell phone and call my mother to congratulate her. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We went to a market to buy things to cook and you can say we had a very pleasant and relaxed day. At night we were all in a good mood, the weather was good and we were going to enjoy that space. It's funny how you learn to enjoy things only in situations like these. When the human being has everything, sometimes he doesn't enjoy it. However, we every space we had tried to have a good time. We didn't know how many days we were going to stay and we wanted to take things easy, take our time; since after leaving everything changed. We started - with insecurities, with fears, we dealt with all kinds of thoughts and feelings, the stress returned and we suffered the same and other needs. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We drank beer in one of the squares, which was frowned upon by Hondurans because they don't drink beer in the street, but out of ignorance we did it. We did not know that it was prohibited in the country. We had no knowledge of that rule. After a few moments, two police officers arrived and asked us to follow them to the delegation and when we arrived they asked us for papers to return to Nicaragua, because what we were doing was illegal. We try several forms of negotiation. We begged them to let us leave, but they did not accept the deal. </p> </div>

<div> <p> We told them that if they returned us to Nicaragua we would have to start over, but now without money because we no longer had and our family was not in a position to help us. It was a terrible situation and a shame for our families if they found out that the police had handcuffed us because of taking in the street. Then, we began to see how else we could get rid and avoid being returned. Within the group there was a friend who spoke perfect Spanish, so much so that the inspector was impressed by his fluency. At the end . the inspector told us that we could leave conditioned; He warned us that the next day we should leave the country, ■. if they weren't going to report to the migration offices for ■ the same situation. They grabbed us with a cooler full of beer and they had it. Very carefully, before we retired we dared to ask them to continue in the apartment, but they told us no, that those beers had already changed owners. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> When we arrived at the apartment, none of us said anything about it, because it was a bad experience, even if it was insignificant for us. While we had already passed the fright, we feared being returned to Nicaragua, because it is one of the worst countries we were going through. For us it was an unnecessary experience. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> In the morning we prepare to leave the country, due to the agreement we made with the police. At eight in the morning we were already in migration and they gave us an appointment for two in the afternoon. We return to the house to cook and prepare to leave and at one we return to wait for the truck. It was a special truck, because in some countries we are going through migration, he advised taxis to charge us double. For us it was no problem because what we wanted was to continue. When we were in the truck it was 1:30 and three people were missing. Simply the driver did not feel like waiting for others and when you pay the ticket and do not arrive, you lose the money. We talked with the driver, but he would not agree. At least we tried. Truly for us it was not so important. Unfortunately, one has to think selfishly and do anything above whoever it is to defend his person and follow the objective. The others stayed and we continued. We wanted to turn the page io as quickly as possible and continue to leave Honduras, thinking it well, it was not so pleasant to be there. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> At the time of the trip everyone joked with the impatience of discovering another land. In each country we were going to cross, fortunately we found a friend, relative or acquaintance who had already gone through that experience. Then, they explained to us how we should pass, to whom we should pay or if we could pass directly. When we arrive at the Guatemalan border at dawn, we follow the instructions so that nobody steals our personal belongings. We knew beforehand that we would meet fake guides, fake taxi drivers, as well as people from the street that we distrusted, because they always wanted to get us money. We were rarely lucky enough to not pay. This time we paid to go to migration, which was in a market. </p> </div>

<div> <p> As Cubans paid a lot of money to cross the border, abusive guides made them cross a hill to get more money, while they allowed us to cross directly. Upon getting into the taxi that would lead us to the border, the taxi driver told us that we could all cross there. Without much thought, at that moment we paid the taxi driver five dollars more to provide us with information. It is amazing how people give so much value to money and where there is money anyone can be corrupted, no matter how firm it is. Very, very few people gave us something without asking for anything in return. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The truck had very loud music and as we walked through the streets of Guatemala todo'mundo looked at us, as if they had never seen people of color, or maybe it was what they saw us with admiration, I would like to think That was the second. It was a strange thing that sometimes when people saw us, we thought we were Americans and they wanted to speak to us in English. Which makes me think they had no idea what kind of migration had reached that border. We looked at the road and realized that it looked like the periphery. </p> </div>

 <div class = "photo"> <figure> <img src = "images / SobrevivSecondHalf-9.jpg" /> </figure> </div>

 <div> <p> Chapter IX. Guatemala </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Nonstop </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Guatemala, for us it was one of the fastest trips. When the taxi driver left us in front of the migration offices, we realized that it was not really the migration office. Inside an public market there was an office to receive migrants, in which we obtained a document valid for twenty days, although we should not stay in the city more than twenty-four hours after obtaining it. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> While we were waiting for the bus we looked for a bathroom to brush our teeth and a restaurant to eat. We were scrambled with the Cubans, who had also done the group tour. While we were getting ready, a lady came to offer us coffee. She was a religious lady with a big heart, who then fed us all and made a beautiful and long prayer with us. We sat down and talked with her, it was a blessing. He felt empathy for us, because he let us know that he was aware of the suffering we had been through, we were going through and we would still pass. It was extremely rare for someone to put ourselves in our shoes, nobody had done it until that moment. It was as if he had been observing those humiliations we are going through. The feeling was so beautiful. that produced us, to the point that we couldn't hide our tears. We were at a breaking point,. as the Bible says, like a fragile vessel. We can read in • Revelation 21: 4, King James Version (1960): "God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will be no death, there will be no more crying or crying or pain; because the first things happened." One more episode was over. We missed seeing someone showing compassion and acceptance. ';> 1 </p> </div>

 <div> <p> She gave us her help, although she didn't have many resources, so we felt very satisfied with what little she could do. Very few people had welcomed us - until that moment - in such a way. She could not stay with us for a long time; His company would have been very good, since we had more hours to wait for the bus. The lady promised that she would return tomorrow if God wanted to. And he would do it every day to help other groups of migrants, because they kept arriving every morning at almost the same time. But it was not more than half a day before we started our route to Mexico. </p> </div>

<div> <p> As soon as the buses arrived, we lined up waiting to be called by name to take our places. There were three buses that were going to transport around 150 people. As soon as we were all on the bus, the police carried out a verification, to see that everything was fine. There were some who did not pay and those who barely had enough money to do so. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> There was no day when we did not think that the authorities or the "coyotes" would abuse us, because they should not have taken us to a land transport terminal; We could have bought the tickets ourselves, but that was not so important because we already wanted to leave that country and move on to the next one. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The truck finally got out for. to reach the capital, and from there we had to take another to reach the border of Mexico. We spent a few hours on the short trip, we couldn't rest because the bus, river. It was very comfortable. </p> </div>

<div> <p> During the trip, on the bus we talked about the possibility of living in Mexico and about the option of deportation. They were things we thought about all the time. We could not stop having those thoughts. Impossible to stop the mind in such circumstances. Paulo Coelho said: "the possibility of realizing a dream is what makes life interesting". Our mind played a fundamental role in this journey. One definitely had the responsibility to tame thoughts; because it could be helpful to keep your mind free, but not in the difficult and embarrassing circumstances we go through, where if you don't have it tamed, you can lose control and end up insane. This same author said that when someone wants something they should know that they are at risk and that is why life is worth it. It didn't matter in the end where it would end, whether in the United States or in Mexico; I already felt winner with the mere fact of arriving alive to any of those two places. The risk was worth it. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We arrived at the capital of Guatemala at night, near where migration was. We thought we were going to sleep, but soon we continued the route. We just had to complete the process and print and photocopy the documents necessary to be there. Everyone told us that with that role we could stay twenty days in the country - how ■ if one were interested in staying a second longer-. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Therefore we thanked them for their hospitality and headed to the truck terminal to buy our tickets. When we arrived everything was closed. In Guatemala the bus has no nightlife as in certain countries that we had passed, and we could not buy anything. At the last minute we saw a street vendor selling fritters, but the point was that I didn't want to accept dollars. We explained that we were tourists, a story that helped him change his mind. I didn't have much to eat, but that would be enough to get to Mexico. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> As soon as we could we split up to buy our tickets, and the ticket seller wanted to charge us - the very abusive one - twice the price, which we didn't accept and told him that we would wait for someone else give us the normal price, we were fed up with so much abuse and impunity. The price of the trip was ten dollars and he wanted to charge us twenty. What they ignored was that we had knowledge of prices, of almost everything, because those who had already passed had explained their experience step by step, costs, prices, everything. We did not ignore the true cost. Then he, already realizing that we knew the price, told us to get on the bus. </p> </div>

<div> <p> Unfortunately, each country we crossed had its own weaponry of evil; they looted us, they charged us dearly for meals, water, taxis, the exchange of the dollar, physical and verbal abuse, and yet we were able to continue on our way. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> At five in the morning we were reaching the border between Guatemala and Mexico. In this border the taxis were bicycles with a cabin that could transport three people maximum. They told us that we could not cross without first passing through Mexican customs to have a visa, that we had to pass over a river and they knew that we could not refuse it, in reality not everyone had a passport. We concentrated on the river bank, which we had to cross in a raft. Unfortunately everything was charged in dollar, something unintelligible and inexplicable. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Mexico </p> </div>

 <div class = "photo"> <figure> <img src = "images / SobrevivSecondHalf-10.jpg" /> </figure> </div>

 <div> <p> Rebirth of a new hope </p> </div>

 <div> <p> To reach victory is to go through countless trials, struggles, falls, disappointments, pain; No one can say that he has achieved victory if he has not overcome all this first. We suffer a lot on the road, we suffer infinite afflictions, grief. In the same way, we suffered injustices, humiliations, altercations, threats, assaults; We pass through the valley of death. That is why I can now say that each one of us who arrives in Mexico is more than grateful to God and to life, because up to this point we can tell ourselves winners. </p> </div>

<div> <p> It is sad to realize that only suffering is need when the human being begins to invoke God, it is curious that we need to suffer some kind of anguish to turn to heaven and cry out to God. And it is curious that after you went through all those torments and are now at work, in a place where to sleep and without starving, you will again forget about Him! The human being has a lot of evil within himself, and we quickly forget that we exist thanks to that infinite goodness of God. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> It was convenient for us to arrive during your business hours, that is, from 8:00 a.m. m. at 12:00 p. m. The taxi took us to the city center, from there we walked about four kilometers to reach the immigration station. We were lucky that there weren't many people, it was just us from the group. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Performing the permit process took all day, so we had to stay at the immigration station. Just a month before, migration was deporting all Haitians, but when we arrived we were giving them a stay permit for a month. If you said you were from Congo, you were detained for at least a month. After we were granted permits, we had to find a place to stay, because buses with routes from Tapachula to the north only departed twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. We were able to find Jugares where they hosted us for two or three dollars a night. There were also places where they did not charge us anything, but in return we had to hire their transport service, since they had trucks that were heading north, which cost $ 1200 pesos. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We stayed a week to prepare before the trip. Not only to get fresh and clean to Tijuana, but also for our relatives to send us more money. Meanwhile, we use that time to get a little distracted, go for a walk and meet Tapachula. Every day was the same routine, eating, communicating with the family, waiting for the day of departure and sleeping. There were some of the group who had enough money to continue on their way and continued. However, the rest we took on the task of raising money until each person in the group had for the trip. In the end, we decided to leave on Saturday at 4:00 p. m. We only had ourselves. We had already lived together during all those months, so we were becoming a real family; taking care of each other. This was, to say, the last push among all to Deny Tijuana and hence everyone would see how to cross into the United States. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We left in two trucks. We were hoping to get to know other places during the trip. The trip would last four days, but it was delayed because one of the trucks failed the engine and it took half a day to repair it. We arrived in Tijuana at four and a half days. On the way we communicated with friends who had already denied before to know where to go. The first Haitians who had arrived in Tijuana in the months of May, June, July and August had nowhere to stay and settled in the street, next to a place known as the Breakfast Room of Father Chava. The Tijuana government never imagined that so many foreigners would enter through its doors in such a short period of time. Due to the amount of Haitians, Africans, Muslims, etc. , which were coming right and left, was that other organizations such as the religious began to open, likewise their doors to house the number of people who were sleeping on the street. </p> </div>

<div> <p> It wasn't something we couldn't do, we came from sleeping in the jungle, where you could be devoured, bitten, or died because of a wild animal; So sleeping on public roads and doing our needs in -she was no problem. A black exodus had passed through its streets in the life of this city. It was also that Tijuana began to change his physiognomy. We were barbaric, countless. According to estimates by the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, between 15,000 and 20,000 Haitians arrived at this border. The same was reported by the media. And those of us who stayed in Baja California in September 2017 were about 5000. </p> </div>

 <div class = "photo"> <figure> <img src = "images / SobrevivSecondHalf-11.jpg" /> <figcaption> At first, it was amazing to see how migrants lay down on the street in front of the father's dining room Chick Every time a migrant arrived in the city to the first place that the taxi took him, he went to Father Chava's dining room because there was still no shelter that was willing to receive us. </figcaption> </figure> </div>

 <div> <p> Now I know that Tijuana is one of the cities where migrants from different parts of the world arrive most. Either to use it as a bridge to cross into the United States or, as happened with us, to settle here. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The first expressions of the tijuanenses when seeing us by their avenues were of dislike, of discontent, of discrimination. It seemed they had never seen a black man. Yes they had seen some in isolation, but not so many, and I recognize that that scared. On second thought, if I were in your position I would probably think the same. I know that at that time we didn't look our best. And not all Haitians are good people, nor are all Mexicans. In this exodus both good and bad left Haiti and Brazil. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We arrived with a face of extreme tiredness, with a fierce hunger, with health problems, with strong emotional problems; What we wanted was help! Bathe, change and a place to rest for hours, more than eating. We could no longer sustain ourselves physically. </p> </div>

<div> <p> Very, very apart from what we wanted, the reality consisted of regaining strength, making a line next to Father Chava's Breakfast Bar, where they installed a module of the National Institute of Migration (INM), in collaboration with the Municipal Directorate of Migrant Assistance by Mr. Rosario Lozada, who kindly attended to us and sealed us the job of leaving Tapachula, which indicated the date to cross into the United States. And on one side they put a symbol that could not, according to them, clone. Whether it was a circle, a star, a square, a diamond, a clover, all with their respective color, which could vary. This was very ingenious of him, but the Haitian has no limits, we could manage to modify everything. One of the things we unfortunately developed in this journey was knowing how to manipulate the situation and put things in our favor. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The INM sought a way to organize departures jointly with the US government to receive us. Therefore, the INM generally carried groups of around fifty people per day. In addition, this same institution, with the help of the Beta Group in charge of Mr. Alejandro Salinas and his team, were the ones who distributed to the people in the shelters that were opening in different parts of the city. </p> </ div>

 <div> <p> I connected with a friend who waited for me at the Breakfast Room of Father Chava and from there he directed me to a street called Cañón del Alacrán, just where the Ambassadors Temple is located. of Jesus. Honestly, I was already desperate and did not want to go on hold with group assignments and distribution to get to a shelter. In the Temple Ambassadors of Jesus - in charge of Pastor Gustavo Banda Aceves and his wife Zaida Guíííén López - as in other places, they were listed as they arrived and that is how they left; -They gave priority to the women with children, pregnant women and the sick to leave earlier. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The numbers used them not only to have a count of the people they were receiving, it also served to facilitate coordination with the INM in order to take people to the checkpoint, as the groups could Easily form with the assignment of numbers. That way, migrants did not have to stand in line to be given a date. They had told me that from there they would leave up to thirty a day and that most of those who crossed, managed to reach their destination in the United States, which was mostly Florida, where they arrived with a family member or friend. Those who did not have this privilege made contact with a Haitian pastor who could receive them. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The Temple Ambassadors of Jesus is a church; However, in this emergency situation it became a refuge, so it worked both ways. </p> </div>

<div> <p> It was the largest shelter, it could accommodate up to 600 people. No other place had that ability. The members of that church, especially the Ortega family, were the ones who were there day after day, distributing the places, providing blankets, things of personal hygiene, distributing clothes, food, etc. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The treatment was different, human, respectful, understanding, something we had not seen anywhere else, except with the lady who felt empathy with us on one of the paths. Here they received people at any time, outside in the morning, at night or in the early morning. The door was never closed. But, although the door did not close, many Haitians who just arrived, ignored it, so many families who arrived at 2, 3 or 4 at dawn and stayed outside getting cold until dawn and offered them a place . Complete families. It was something truly impressive. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> In all the places where we were there were infinite rules, but here there were apparently none. Everyone else had time to wake up, eat, bathe, leave, enter; not here. There were two very regulated places; in one of them at five in the morning they took you out of the cold it was, no matter if they were women with children or pregnant women. That was his norm. In addition, it was not a hostel itself; They gave you breakfast and you had to wander around the city until four or five in the afternoon, when they returned to give you entrance if you could reach a place. There was another one of pure men, where they still took you out at five in the morning and at six in the afternoon you had to be back, to mention a few examples. You understand, those were their rules and we had to respect them. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> However, in the Temple Ambassadors of Jesus, that did not exist. You could enter at any time you wanted, but at nine the lights went out and everyone went to sleep. That was the first months because the shepherdess and her husband worked, so they also had to rest a little. To put it in some way, their work day was continuous and endless, because if someone needed something at dawn - which was very common - they had to attend to it. For the. They needed to have some rest time. As an indication of the time to sleep, the shepherd sang a song, with which she implied that we had to turn everything off; It said more or less this: "Until tomorrow, God willing, may you rest well, it was time to go to bed and dream too, because tomorrow you know another day and you have to live it with joy...." It was unusual and very funny. We laughed at her. Even though he got very strict with people, he turned out to have his crazy moments. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> However, I had the bad luck that when I arrived there was no room. The pastor told us that she could not with so many and that they had to send us to another place, so they referred us to the INM, which could only take us to the street in front of Father Chava's Breakfast. This was around eight o'clock at night and, as you were lucky, you had to look for him where you could, in a hotel or in another hostel. I contacted a friend who was staying near the line, where there were spaces in tents for the night. </p> </div>

<div class = "photo"> <figure> <img src = "images / SobrevivSecondHalf-12.jpg" /> <figcaption> Scorpion Canyon, the Ambassadors of Jesus church, the shelter that received almost half of the Haitian migrants for more than six months. The church had more than five hundred Haitians among men, women, children; Everyone was interested in getting there because it was the only shelter in Dondoe Migration sent from ten to thirty people daily, that is to say that every day more people arrived than those who left. There was always food and it was easy to get it, but sometimes people spent more than four hours in the bathroom line, before Pastor Gustavo and his beloved wife - who are considered the protectors and relatives of Haitians, especially by me— enlarge the bathroom to facilitate the use of migrants. There are still about one hundred people in this shelter, to the point that the church started a project since the end of 2016, which they called Little Haiti. </figcaption> </figure> </div>

 <div> <p> But since I am a foolish and insistent man, despite not having been accepted into the Temple, I returned the next day early to look for a space for myself again. I knew that in that place people were leaving soon and arriving at their destination. God was there, because many who were in that church arrived with their relatives or friends. In such a way that I insisted and stayed. Besides, I was also trying to be with my friend, who was already there. because we wanted to try to enter together. The idea was to cross and go to my mother's house, who has lived in Florida for several years. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> My arrival in Tijuana was on December 8, 2016. November and December, it can be said, were the months in which it was easier to enter the United States without being deported. It was like a time of grace. Something happened to Obama, probably because before that he had been declared as the US president who had done more deportations. Many of the Haitians benefited from such a sudden change, through which they were given access to that nation. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Some authorities asked for bribes; They started with $ 200 and eventually ended up charging 400. Who had them, because he paid them to enter before the assigned date. Many, without knowing it, were paying for their deportation. Especially those that happened in the months of September and October. In fact, the "coyotes" also did their job, and I couldn't mention any amount, but there were indeed Haitians who took that path; They had no luck. The charges were between five thousand and seven thousand dollars. Half here, half crossing. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Those who had their turn to appear at US immigration offices, waited a week, two weeks or even a month for the decision to be allowed to enter the United States or deported to Haiti. </p> </div>

<div> <p> From the moment we arrived1 in Tijuana, the INM agents explained that they could not give us papers to stay in Mexico. Actually that was not the goal we were pursuing. Some Haitians thought that the shelters received enough money from the government to help the migrant, and that is why it was not convenient for them to leave these places. For us, they were being benefited thanks to this town. We talked and thought that Mexicans wanted us to stay in the city to have black people in it. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Surely, as everywhere else, several shelters benefited from the departure that each government has for these matters. But not all. We discovered that in other places the pastors of other churches that had opened, were charging 200 pesos per night. They said it wasn't true, but it was. We knew it ourselves, we had acquaintances everywhere and we communicated constantly. Now that I think about it, it was logical, because they had no resources like the places established for migrant care. Somehow they had to cover the expenses generated by the Haitians. I can understand it. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> In the temple where we were there was no charge; It was a church established as a refuge, where it was the faith of the shepherds that succeeded in sustaining so many people. It was a shelter, say emergency, because they had the way to give us a place to sleep. Later we discovered that the shepherds had a foundation, which was Sfama Fundación Regalando Amor, A. C. However, their statutes did not say "migrants", but help disintegrated families and street children. Even so, through this foundation it was that help from the government arrived, but not with the same force as it arrived at the places of attention to the migrant. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The needs of food, blankets, mats, water and very convenient medical days were covered. At one time, there were countless altruistic groups that came to support, such as Los Angeles de Frontera, by Hugo. Castr. or. and Gaba Cortés, who are the ones I remember most. I thank the Tijuana community because they sympathized with us by providing all kinds of food, clothing, etc. I was impressed to see how day after day during those months God's blessings came to that place. Food was plentiful, this was one of the things that fascinated me most, obviously. I also had to see the collaboration of the World Organization for Migration (IOM), by Christopher Gascón. They provided the church with tables, chairs, pots of all kinds for cooking, knives and an industrial zinc to feed so many people. It really was a valuable help. </p> </div>

<div> <p> Of course, the help provided by Migrant Assistance, the Municipal Social Development Department, SEDESOL, the San Diego Methodist Church, by Pastor Elise, the Mission Siloe Foundation, Korean medical groups of. San Diego, an anonymous altruistic character who lives in Los Angeles, and of course the Tijuana community. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Different local churches attended our aid regardless of religion. There I saw Adventists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Catholics participate, and even atheists participated with their valuable collaboration. It was an incredible experience. After a while another institution called Espacio 'Migrante joined, in charge of Paulina Oivera Cáñez, which was given the task of seeking support from lawyers not only from the city, but from the United States. These supported us with. talks about our rights in Mexico, because they were already seeing that we could hardly cross and that many of us would get stuck in this country. ' That they provided us with that information was very significant for the Haitian people. I would like to mention all of them who got involved in this unimaginable work, 'but I don't remember everyone's names. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Something that caught my attention was the work of a young man named Terry and two of his friends; they were given the task of filling the church with mattresses for everyone. They came from Santa Monica, California - if I remember correctly. How did it cover that need, who took so many good mattresses that did not allow us to go cold? His work was very remarkable and I feel infinitely grateful for that. It provided comfort and rest. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Even with all this, many Haitians began to despair at the expectation of having an opportunity to enter the United States. In the Temple sometimes everything went out of control with the exits; It was very difficult to control so many people and everyone wanting to go, even if it wasn't their turn. Sometimes we calmed down, sometimes not. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The INM already knew that entering the United States for Haitians was going to get complicated and was aware of the number of deportees; So it made sense that we were presented with the option - right now - to stay here through a visa for humanitarian reasons. This option was not what we would have liked, but it was what we had on the table to drink. Some, seeing that things got difficult, after having suffered so much, inexplicably made the decision to be returned to Brazil or Haiti, so the government made it easier for them to travel. </p> </ div >

 <div> <p> Others like me have decided to stay in Tijuana. It was not an easy decision, especially for the effort and support-that our relatives had given us to make this trip in order to arrive with our families based in the United States, with the expectation that already being there we would reward them with our work. The majority acquired debts in Haiti with the bank, with their friends, with their relatives, or sold what little they had in order to pursue the "American dream". What a false illusion. After all this, returning was not fair. </p> </div>

<div> <p> In the end, I can say that it was a decision that God made, which compared to what we would expect in the United States, was the best. I have friends who are still imprisoned in some US jail. UU. waiting to be deported, and others already in Haiti. Sadly a large part of them did not live in Haiti. Some did not even have relatives there. They had been raised in Brazil, in the Dominican Republic or in Chile; I don't even want to imagine the triple suffering they experienced when they got there, to a country they didn't know, know where and know who. The first suffering was caused by leaving their place of origin and leaving everything to bet on nothing; the second, to reach a border city, not knowing anyone and seeking their survival; and the third, spend months in jail without being criminals, just for the simple fact of wanting to have a better life; live with real criminals and suffer again cold and hunger. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> In my case, I was hoping to earn more money than I earned in Brazil. There they paid us approximately 1300 reais a month, which would be like 300 dollars. But I discovered that here in Mexico that payment is a week or a fortnight, wonderful. I realized that here in Mexico money is not so important; You can eat well with little money. You can work and rest in the afternoon or work at night and rest in the morning. In the United States I would not have the peace that I have had to live in Mexico. I know there are people who must have up to three jobs to be able to support themselves. In addition, here there is no racism to the same degree as in the United States, we feel the respect of most people. I appreciated the advantage that here, seeing that we would not cross and that that was no longer an option, we found a way to work without papers and without any problems. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> As of January 10, 2017, the United States could no longer be entered. Only pregnant women and children had possibilities and, even so, many were deported, sadly some a few days after giving birth and ended up giving birth in Haiti. So staying was the only real option for around 5000 Haitian people who were living in Baja California. Currently, the figure has decreased because many requested their return; According to the information provided by the INM, we are tentatively here between 2500 and 3000. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> My perception of borders </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Brazil </p> </div>

<div> <p> We know that, across the world, border trade is one of the economic forces that each country shares with its neighboring country, but some of them cannot benefit from this opportunity due to lack of production. This is the case in the Americas, - generating poverty in many countries! </p> </div>

 <div> <p> "Most countries" in the Americas are connected by their borders, however, this does not prevent them from having major economic deficiencies. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> To begin this study, I crossed several countries and took the time to see that some exchanges take place in particular ways. Thus, Brazil is the only country that shares a border with France through the department of Guyana. The only two countries in South America that do not share a border with Brazil are Ecuador and Chile. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We have not been able to visit all the borders shared by Brazil, but we conducted a visual study of the border trade between Bolivia and Brazil. These countries have very different imports in South America. Brazil is the most powerful distributor of agriculture in this region and Boiivia is one of the poorest countries in South America. This border has become increasingly insecure due to the exchange of cocaine that distributors in these states are doing. But clearly Brazil has always had its way of progress due to its livestock and agriculture, which are very powerful exchanges between them. However, this exchange seems to be more or less unique because Bolivia has almost nothing to offer Brazil, except immigrants. Brazil is also known as a country that opens its doors and welcomes immigrants, in the same way it is considered a superpower. Despite its fall in the World Cup, Brazil remains the leader of South America. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The border between Brasif and Peru is one of the most peaceful borders because trade does not take place in the same way as in Guyana (province of the French metropolis). Between Brazil and Peru there are fewer drugs. Peruvians use that border to enter and work because in Brazil, work is easier if compared to that of the countries of South America. Brazil is a place where anyone can get papers quickly and easily. '</p> </div>

 <div> <p> Peru-Ecuador </p> </div>

 <div> <p> On the border between Peru and Ecuador, the economic atmosphere is managed by a very active market. In almost every frontier studied, unfortunately, prostitution is one of the most widespread trades. This is well known. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Both countries have different currencies, Ecuador manages the US dollar, which still pushes a very large exchange with Peru. This undoubtedly gives a way of passage for drug traffickers and human traffickers who have made it even easier for immigrants from Brazil, Venezuela and Chile to cross the border. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Ecuador-Colombia </p> </div>

<div> <p> Colombia is known as one of the main cocaine producing countries in the world. On their shared border with Ecuador, for example, they used the mountains near the border to transport any type of illegal thing. Immigrants knew some of these roads because not everyone could go directly, so there were crossroads to cross. The houses there had an alarm system. In such a way that border crime was more popular than peace. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Colombia-Panama </p> </div>

 <div> <p> In fact, there is no border between Colombia and Panama, among them there is a forest called Darien Gap, which has the highest average number of traffickers who circulate their drugs. In general, these two countries do not share love with each other and there is only one possible passage to travel from Colombia to Panama, it is by air, because there is no other way to go, unless you decide to cross the entire forest that has about 160 km long Immigrants use this dangerous road to cross and enter the soil of Panama (more details in the book). </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Panama-Costa Rica </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Along all borders, the drug is very poorly controlled by the authorities because young people are smarter than they are. On the border between Panama and Costa Rica, the sale of marijuana is very popular. It gives the police more work, however, as something contradictory peace reigns across the border. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The populations of both territories are able to travel and return without any problem, which makes the vast circulation of drugs much easier. The. which turns out to be very favorable for all these unscrupulous people who come and go as they please. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Costa Rica-Nicaragua </p> </div>

<div> <p> Unfortunately it is the least pleasant place, people are not very friendly. The basis of its border is customs, because Costa Rica does not engage in any kind of relationship with its neighbor in the form of a market, as seen in other borders. For a Nicaraguan, it is mandatory to cross Costa Rican soil with a visa, because these two countries do not have the same economic level. Here things are handled differently, the Nicaraguan who lives in Costa Rica must have a residence card, otherwise he will be deported. It's that easy. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The only allowed trade in which you don't need documents is the prostitution market! </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Nicaragua-Honduras </p> </div>

 <div> <p> No one can describe the situation of the border between Nicaragua and Honduras, due to the way to cross into Nicaragua. Very few know what the realidat frontier is like, because it is one of the territories that has not been analyzed, not only because it is illegal to cross it, but also it was not accepted that immigrants put 'foot in their soil without having a visa. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Honduras-Guatemala </p> </div>

 <div> <p> ■ It is the quietest border we crossed because commercial activity was quite weak compared to other borders we were able to cross. The main objective of the trip was not to analyze the borders, but I, who am very observant, took it as part of my experience from the beginning to the end, every little detail mattered. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Guatemala-Mexico </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Mexico is the first country in North America when it comes through Central America. Guatemala is very open with Mexico - if one takes into account how the process was to cross the border - but the economic activities of the two countries share a very rich border trade, especially coffee. There was no big news compared to the other borders we had crossed, it was almost the same, but on a larger scale. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Mexico-United States </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The border between the United States and Mexico covers about 3200 kilometers, and extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Baptized as "the border tortilla", it is the busiest border in the world, with 181 million people who crossed the entire border shared with the United States of America (2015). </p> </div>

<div> <p> However, between 2016 and 2017 immigrants took two routes to cross through Baja California, which made it easier for them to reach their destination. This fact gave us a little more time to do a broader study on borders, particularly that of Tijuana. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> This border city plays a very important role. important in the economy of Mexico. It is one of the most sought after cities by immigrants; there is easy access, aj sex and drugs, which is why Americans enjoy a lot, in addition to its rich cuisine and culture. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Crime in this region is stronger than the armed forces, but this does not prevent the population from being happy. The heart of the city is the Revolution Street of happy Tijuana. Artisans and artists play a very important role in the image of the city. The economy of this border is dynamic, it can be said that a little gentle; but effective. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Reality </p> </div>

 <div> <p> I wonder sometimes: what do we really fear? To die, to hell, to illness or to failure? We know that you don't have to worry about failures, but about missed opportunities. In life one has two options and both are acceptable: to assume responsibility for our life and do our best with our possibilities in order to hunt the darkness; or leave you guide-by your own will, with which you will never stay in the dark. Because a fish inside a well cannot know the ocean. ■ </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Do not admit that your misery is already written, that this is your destiny; Our destiny is chosen by each one. We have a pencil and an eraser, and we have to know how to use them for fairer causes, but they won't be there every day. We have all made sacrifices in life because of money, sacrifices we never make for love. Learn that we are human, that we have a heart and that we just have to place our hands. on top of him to feel a beat that tells you that you are alive. That heart is your home, to which you will cease to enter the love of God, who will dwell there and replace hate and the devil. One chooses every day what is best, good and fair. Simply clean our heart to see all the riches we have, prosperity, future and our dreams. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Stop looking anxiously at the places you can see, control your surroundings and focus on the opportunities. Realize them, one after another, and let your will and your inner peace make good decisions. Do not say that you do not have enough time, that it is best to shorten, take a quick alternative. Don't let people think for you, make your own decisions. Give importance to every minor detail, so you don't pay major consequences. You must find enough patience and perseverance. P. A. U. R: Patience, Love, Union, and Respect. And don't be a slave to your own goals; Always try to have a plan B. Do not give up what you have fought for just because everything did not go as you wanted or expected. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> After all, things don't depend on a person or money; Your happiness depends on the love you have in your heart. Learn to be confident in yourself and you will see that everything you can do, since that will feed you. </p> </div>
