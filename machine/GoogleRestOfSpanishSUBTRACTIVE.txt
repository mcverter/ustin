 <div> <p> Mexico is the first country in North America when it comes through Central America. Guatemala is very open with Mexico - if one takes into account how the process was to cross the border - but the economic activities of the two countries share a very rich border trade, especially coffee. There was no big news compared to the other borders we had crossed, it was almost the same, but on a larger scale. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Mexico-United States </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The border between the United States and Mexico covers about 3200 kilometers, and extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Baptized as "the border tortilla", it is the busiest border in the world, with 181 million people who crossed the entire border shared with the United States of America (2015). </p> </div>

<div> <p> However, between 2016 and 2017 immigrants took two routes to cross through Baja California, which made it easier for them to reach their destination. This fact gave us a little more time to do a broader study on borders, particularly that of Tijuana. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> This border city plays a very important role. important in the economy of Mexico. It is one of the most sought after cities by immigrants; there is easy access, aj sex and drugs, which is why Americans enjoy a lot, in addition to its rich cuisine and culture. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Crime in this region is stronger than the armed forces, but this does not prevent the population from being happy. The heart of the city is the Revolution Street of happy Tijuana. Artisans and artists play a very important role in the image of the city. The economy of this border is dynamic, it can be said that a little gentle; but effective. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Reality </p> </div>

 <div> <p> I wonder sometimes: what do we really fear? To die, to hell, to illness or to failure? We know that you don't have to worry about failures, but about missed opportunities. In life one has two options and both are acceptable: to assume responsibility for our life and do our best with our possibilities in order to hunt the darkness; or leave you guide-by your own will, with which you will never stay in the dark. Because a fish inside a well cannot know the ocean. ■ </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Do not admit that your misery is already written, that this is your destiny; Our destiny is chosen by each one. We have a pencil and an eraser, and we have to know how to use them for fairer causes, but they won't be there every day. We have all made sacrifices in life because of money, sacrifices we never make for love. Learn that we are human, that we have a heart and that we just have to place our hands. on top of him to feel a beat that tells you that you are alive. That heart is your home, to which you will cease to enter the love of God, who will dwell there and replace hate and the devil. One chooses every day what is best, good and fair. Simply clean our heart to see all the riches we have, prosperity, future and our dreams. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Stop looking anxiously at the places you can see, control your surroundings and focus on the opportunities. Realize them, one after another, and let your will and your inner peace make good decisions. Do not say that you do not have enough time, that it is best to shorten, take a quick alternative. Don't let people think for you, make your own decisions. Give importance to every minor detail, so you don't pay major consequences. You must find enough patience and perseverance. P. A. U. R: Patience, Love, Union, and Respect. And don't be a slave to your own goals; Always try to have a plan B. Do not give up what you have fought for just because everything did not go as you wanted or expected. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> After all, things don't depend on a person or money; Your happiness depends on the love you have in your heart. Learn to be confident in yourself and you will see that everything you can do, since that will feed you. </p> </div>
