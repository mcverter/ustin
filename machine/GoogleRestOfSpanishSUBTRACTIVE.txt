<div> <p> We know that, across the world, border trade is one of the economic forces that each country shares with its neighboring country, but some of them cannot benefit from this opportunity due to lack of production. This is the case in the Americas, - generating poverty in many countries! </p> </div>

 <div> <p> "Most countries" in the Americas are connected by their borders, however, this does not prevent them from having major economic deficiencies. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> To begin this study, I crossed several countries and took the time to see that some exchanges take place in particular ways. Thus, Brazil is the only country that shares a border with France through the department of Guyana. The only two countries in South America that do not share a border with Brazil are Ecuador and Chile. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We have not been able to visit all the borders shared by Brazil, but we conducted a visual study of the border trade between Bolivia and Brazil. These countries have very different imports in South America. Brazil is the most powerful distributor of agriculture in this region and Boiivia is one of the poorest countries in South America. This border has become increasingly insecure due to the exchange of cocaine that distributors in these states are doing. But clearly Brazil has always had its way of progress due to its livestock and agriculture, which are very powerful exchanges between them. However, this exchange seems to be more or less unique because Bolivia has almost nothing to offer Brazil, except immigrants. Brazil is also known as a country that opens its doors and welcomes immigrants, in the same way it is considered a superpower. Despite its fall in the World Cup, Brazil remains the leader of South America. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The border between Brasif and Peru is one of the most peaceful borders because trade does not take place in the same way as in Guyana (province of the French metropolis). Between Brazil and Peru there are fewer drugs. Peruvians use that border to enter and work because in Brazil, work is easier if compared to that of the countries of South America. Brazil is a place where anyone can get papers quickly and easily. '</p> </div>

 <div> <p> Peru-Ecuador </p> </div>

 <div> <p> On the border between Peru and Ecuador, the economic atmosphere is managed by a very active market. In almost every frontier studied, unfortunately, prostitution is one of the most widespread trades. This is well known. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Both countries have different currencies, Ecuador manages the US dollar, which still pushes a very large exchange with Peru. This undoubtedly gives a way of passage for drug traffickers and human traffickers who have made it even easier for immigrants from Brazil, Venezuela and Chile to cross the border. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Ecuador-Colombia </p> </div>

<div> <p> Colombia is known as one of the main cocaine producing countries in the world. On their shared border with Ecuador, for example, they used the mountains near the border to transport any type of illegal thing. Immigrants knew some of these roads because not everyone could go directly, so there were crossroads to cross. The houses there had an alarm system. In such a way that border crime was more popular than peace. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Colombia-Panama </p> </div>

 <div> <p> In fact, there is no border between Colombia and Panama, among them there is a forest called Darien Gap, which has the highest average number of traffickers who circulate their drugs. In general, these two countries do not share love with each other and there is only one possible passage to travel from Colombia to Panama, it is by air, because there is no other way to go, unless you decide to cross the entire forest that has about 160 km long Immigrants use this dangerous road to cross and enter the soil of Panama (more details in the book). </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Panama-Costa Rica </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Along all borders, the drug is very poorly controlled by the authorities because young people are smarter than they are. On the border between Panama and Costa Rica, the sale of marijuana is very popular. It gives the police more work, however, as something contradictory peace reigns across the border. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The populations of both territories are able to travel and return without any problem, which makes the vast circulation of drugs much easier. The. which turns out to be very favorable for all these unscrupulous people who come and go as they please. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Costa Rica-Nicaragua </p> </div>

<div> <p> Unfortunately it is the least pleasant place, people are not very friendly. The basis of its border is customs, because Costa Rica does not engage in any kind of relationship with its neighbor in the form of a market, as seen in other borders. For a Nicaraguan, it is mandatory to cross Costa Rican soil with a visa, because these two countries do not have the same economic level. Here things are handled differently, the Nicaraguan who lives in Costa Rica must have a residence card, otherwise he will be deported. It's that easy. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The only allowed trade in which you don't need documents is the prostitution market! </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Nicaragua-Honduras </p> </div>

 <div> <p> No one can describe the situation of the border between Nicaragua and Honduras, due to the way to cross into Nicaragua. Very few know what the realidat frontier is like, because it is one of the territories that has not been analyzed, not only because it is illegal to cross it, but also it was not accepted that immigrants put 'foot in their soil without having a visa. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Honduras-Guatemala </p> </div>

 <div> <p> ■ It is the quietest border we crossed because commercial activity was quite weak compared to other borders we were able to cross. The main objective of the trip was not to analyze the borders, but I, who am very observant, took it as part of my experience from the beginning to the end, every little detail mattered. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Guatemala-Mexico </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Mexico is the first country in North America when it comes through Central America. Guatemala is very open with Mexico - if one takes into account how the process was to cross the border - but the economic activities of the two countries share a very rich border trade, especially coffee. There was no big news compared to the other borders we had crossed, it was almost the same, but on a larger scale. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Mexico-United States </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The border between the United States and Mexico covers about 3200 kilometers, and extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Baptized as "the border tortilla", it is the busiest border in the world, with 181 million people who crossed the entire border shared with the United States of America (2015). </p> </div>

<div> <p> However, between 2016 and 2017 immigrants took two routes to cross through Baja California, which made it easier for them to reach their destination. This fact gave us a little more time to do a broader study on borders, particularly that of Tijuana. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> This border city plays a very important role. important in the economy of Mexico. It is one of the most sought after cities by immigrants; there is easy access, aj sex and drugs, which is why Americans enjoy a lot, in addition to its rich cuisine and culture. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Crime in this region is stronger than the armed forces, but this does not prevent the population from being happy. The heart of the city is the Revolution Street of happy Tijuana. Artisans and artists play a very important role in the image of the city. The economy of this border is dynamic, it can be said that a little gentle; but effective. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Reality </p> </div>

 <div> <p> I wonder sometimes: what do we really fear? To die, to hell, to illness or to failure? We know that you don't have to worry about failures, but about missed opportunities. In life one has two options and both are acceptable: to assume responsibility for our life and do our best with our possibilities in order to hunt the darkness; or leave you guide-by your own will, with which you will never stay in the dark. Because a fish inside a well cannot know the ocean. ■ </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Do not admit that your misery is already written, that this is your destiny; Our destiny is chosen by each one. We have a pencil and an eraser, and we have to know how to use them for fairer causes, but they won't be there every day. We have all made sacrifices in life because of money, sacrifices we never make for love. Learn that we are human, that we have a heart and that we just have to place our hands. on top of him to feel a beat that tells you that you are alive. That heart is your home, to which you will cease to enter the love of God, who will dwell there and replace hate and the devil. One chooses every day what is best, good and fair. Simply clean our heart to see all the riches we have, prosperity, future and our dreams. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Stop looking anxiously at the places you can see, control your surroundings and focus on the opportunities. Realize them, one after another, and let your will and your inner peace make good decisions. Do not say that you do not have enough time, that it is best to shorten, take a quick alternative. Don't let people think for you, make your own decisions. Give importance to every minor detail, so you don't pay major consequences. You must find enough patience and perseverance. P. A. U. R: Patience, Love, Union, and Respect. And don't be a slave to your own goals; Always try to have a plan B. Do not give up what you have fought for just because everything did not go as you wanted or expected. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> After all, things don't depend on a person or money; Your happiness depends on the love you have in your heart. Learn to be confident in yourself and you will see that everything you can do, since that will feed you. </p> </div>
