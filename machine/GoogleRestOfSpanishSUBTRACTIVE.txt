<div> <p> Unfortunately, each country we crossed had its own weaponry of evil; they looted us, they charged us dearly for meals, water, taxis, the exchange of the dollar, physical and verbal abuse, and yet we were able to continue on our way. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> At five in the morning we were reaching the border between Guatemala and Mexico. In this border the taxis were bicycles with a cabin that could transport three people maximum. They told us that we could not cross without first passing through Mexican customs to have a visa, that we had to pass over a river and they knew that we could not refuse it, in reality not everyone had a passport. We concentrated on the river bank, which we had to cross in a raft. Unfortunately everything was charged in dollar, something unintelligible and inexplicable. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Mexico </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Rebirth of a new hope </p> </div>

 <div> <p> To reach victory is to go through countless trials, struggles, falls, disappointments, pain; No one can say that he has achieved victory if he has not overcome all this first. We suffer a lot on the road, we suffer infinite afflictions, grief. In the same way, we suffered injustices, humiliations, altercations, threats, assaults; We pass through the valley of death. That is why I can now say that each one of us who arrives in Mexico is more than grateful to God and to life, because up to this point we can tell ourselves winners. </p> </div>

<div> <p> It is sad to realize that only suffering is need when the human being begins to invoke God, it is curious that we need to suffer some kind of anguish to turn to heaven and cry out to God. And it is curious that after you went through all those torments and are now at work, in a place where to sleep and without starving, you will again forget about Him! The human being has a lot of evil within himself, and we quickly forget that we exist thanks to that infinite goodness of God. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> It was convenient for us to arrive during your business hours, that is, from 8:00 a.m. m. at 12:00 p. m. The taxi took us to the city center, from there we walked about four kilometers to reach the immigration station. We were lucky that there weren't many people, it was just us from the group. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Performing the permit process took all day, so we had to stay at the immigration station. Just a month before, migration was deporting all Haitians, but when we arrived we were giving them a stay permit for a month. If you said you were from Congo, you were detained for at least a month. After we were granted permits, we had to find a place to stay, because buses with routes from Tapachula to the north only departed twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. We were able to find Jugares where they hosted us for two or three dollars a night. There were also places where they did not charge us anything, but in return we had to hire their transport service, since they had trucks that were heading north, which cost $ 1200 pesos. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We stayed a week to prepare before the trip. Not only to get fresh and clean to Tijuana, but also for our relatives to send us more money. Meanwhile, we use that time to get a little distracted, go for a walk and meet Tapachula. Every day was the same routine, eating, communicating with the family, waiting for the day of departure and sleeping. There were some of the group who had enough money to continue on their way and continued. However, the rest we took on the task of raising money until each person in the group had for the trip. In the end, we decided to leave on Saturday at 4:00 p. m. We only had ourselves. We had already lived together during all those months, so we were becoming a real family; taking care of each other. This was, to say, the last push among all to Deny Tijuana and hence everyone would see how to cross into the United States. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We left in two trucks. We were hoping to get to know other places during the trip. The trip would last four days, but it was delayed because one of the trucks failed the engine and it took half a day to repair it. We arrived in Tijuana at four and a half days. On the way we communicated with friends who had already denied before to know where to go. The first Haitians who had arrived in Tijuana in the months of May, June, July and August had nowhere to stay and settled in the street, next to a place known as the Breakfast Room of Father Chava. The Tijuana government never imagined that so many foreigners would enter through its doors in such a short period of time. Due to the amount of Haitians, Africans, Muslims, etc. , which were coming right and left, was that other organizations such as the religious began to open, likewise their doors to house the number of people who were sleeping on the street. </p> </div>

<div> <p> It wasn't something we couldn't do, we came from sleeping in the jungle, where you could be devoured, bitten, or died because of a wild animal; So sleeping on public roads and doing our needs in -she was no problem. A black exodus had passed through its streets in the life of this city. It was also that Tijuana began to change his physiognomy. We were barbaric, countless. According to estimates by the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, between 15,000 and 20,000 Haitians arrived at this border. The same was reported by the media. And those of us who stayed in Baja California in September 2017 were about 5000. </p> </div>

 <div class = "photo"> <figure> <img src = "images / SobrevivSecondHalf-11.jpg" /> <figcaption> At first, it was amazing to see how migrants lay down on the street in front of the father's dining room Chick Every time a migrant arrived in the city to the first place that the taxi took him, he went to Father Chava's dining room because there was still no shelter that was willing to receive us. </figcaption> </figure> </div>

 <div> <p> Now I know that Tijuana is one of the cities where migrants from different parts of the world arrive most. Either to use it as a bridge to cross into the United States or, as happened with us, to settle here. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The first expressions of the tijuanenses when seeing us by their avenues were of dislike, of discontent, of discrimination. It seemed they had never seen a black man. Yes they had seen some in isolation, but not so many, and I recognize that that scared. On second thought, if I were in your position I would probably think the same. I know that at that time we didn't look our best. And not all Haitians are good people, nor are all Mexicans. In this exodus both good and bad left Haiti and Brazil. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We arrived with a face of extreme tiredness, with a fierce hunger, with health problems, with strong emotional problems; What we wanted was help! Bathe, change and a place to rest for hours, more than eating. We could no longer sustain ourselves physically. </p> </div>

<div> <p> Very, very apart from what we wanted, the reality consisted of regaining strength, making a line next to Father Chava's Breakfast Bar, where they installed a module of the National Institute of Migration (INM), in collaboration with the Municipal Directorate of Migrant Assistance by Mr. Rosario Lozada, who kindly attended to us and sealed us the job of leaving Tapachula, which indicated the date to cross into the United States. And on one side they put a symbol that could not, according to them, clone. Whether it was a circle, a star, a square, a diamond, a clover, all with their respective color, which could vary. This was very ingenious of him, but the Haitian has no limits, we could manage to modify everything. One of the things we unfortunately developed in this journey was knowing how to manipulate the situation and put things in our favor. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The INM sought a way to organize departures jointly with the US government to receive us. Therefore, the INM generally carried groups of around fifty people per day. In addition, this same institution, with the help of the Beta Group in charge of Mr. Alejandro Salinas and his team, were the ones who distributed to the people in the shelters that were opening in different parts of the city. </p> </ div>

 <div> <p> I connected with a friend who waited for me at the Breakfast Room of Father Chava and from there he directed me to a street called Cañón del Alacrán, just where the Ambassadors Temple is located. of Jesus. Honestly, I was already desperate and did not want to go on hold with group assignments and distribution to get to a shelter. In the Temple Ambassadors of Jesus - in charge of Pastor Gustavo Banda Aceves and his wife Zaida Guíííén López - as in other places, they were listed as they arrived and that is how they left; -They gave priority to the women with children, pregnant women and the sick to leave earlier. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The numbers used them not only to have a count of the people they were receiving, it also served to facilitate coordination with the INM in order to take people to the checkpoint, as the groups could Easily form with the assignment of numbers. That way, migrants did not have to stand in line to be given a date. They had told me that from there they would leave up to thirty a day and that most of those who crossed, managed to reach their destination in the United States, which was mostly Florida, where they arrived with a family member or friend. Those who did not have this privilege made contact with a Haitian pastor who could receive them. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The Temple Ambassadors of Jesus is a church; However, in this emergency situation it became a refuge, so it worked both ways. </p> </div>

<div> <p> It was the largest shelter, it could accommodate up to 600 people. No other place had that ability. The members of that church, especially the Ortega family, were the ones who were there day after day, distributing the places, providing blankets, things of personal hygiene, distributing clothes, food, etc. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The treatment was different, human, respectful, understanding, something we had not seen anywhere else, except with the lady who felt empathy with us on one of the paths. Here they received people at any time, outside in the morning, at night or in the early morning. The door was never closed. But, although the door did not close, many Haitians who just arrived, ignored it, so many families who arrived at 2, 3 or 4 at dawn and stayed outside getting cold until dawn and offered them a place . Complete families. It was something truly impressive. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> In all the places where we were there were infinite rules, but here there were apparently none. Everyone else had time to wake up, eat, bathe, leave, enter; not here. There were two very regulated places; in one of them at five in the morning they took you out of the cold it was, no matter if they were women with children or pregnant women. That was his norm. In addition, it was not a hostel itself; They gave you breakfast and you had to wander around the city until four or five in the afternoon, when they returned to give you entrance if you could reach a place. There was another one of pure men, where they still took you out at five in the morning and at six in the afternoon you had to be back, to mention a few examples. You understand, those were their rules and we had to respect them. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> However, in the Temple Ambassadors of Jesus, that did not exist. You could enter at any time you wanted, but at nine the lights went out and everyone went to sleep. That was the first months because the shepherdess and her husband worked, so they also had to rest a little. To put it in some way, their work day was continuous and endless, because if someone needed something at dawn - which was very common - they had to attend to it. For the. They needed to have some rest time. As an indication of the time to sleep, the shepherd sang a song, with which she implied that we had to turn everything off; It said more or less this: "Until tomorrow, God willing, may you rest well, it was time to go to bed and dream too, because tomorrow you know another day and you have to live it with joy...." It was unusual and very funny. We laughed at her. Even though he got very strict with people, he turned out to have his crazy moments. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> However, I had the bad luck that when I arrived there was no room. The pastor told us that she could not with so many and that they had to send us to another place, so they referred us to the INM, which could only take us to the street in front of Father Chava's Breakfast. This was around eight o'clock at night and, as you were lucky, you had to look for him where you could, in a hotel or in another hostel. I contacted a friend who was staying near the line, where there were spaces in tents for the night. </p> </div>

<div class = "photo"> <figure> <img src = "images / SobrevivSecondHalf-12.jpg" /> <figcaption> Scorpion Canyon, the Ambassadors of Jesus church, the shelter that received almost half of the Haitian migrants for more than six months. The church had more than five hundred Haitians among men, women, children; Everyone was interested in getting there because it was the only shelter in Dondoe Migration sent from ten to thirty people daily, that is to say that every day more people arrived than those who left. There was always food and it was easy to get it, but sometimes people spent more than four hours in the bathroom line, before Pastor Gustavo and his beloved wife - who are considered the protectors and relatives of Haitians, especially by me— enlarge the bathroom to facilitate the use of migrants. There are still about one hundred people in this shelter, to the point that the church started a project since the end of 2016, which they called Little Haiti. </figcaption> </figure> </div>

 <div> <p> But since I am a foolish and insistent man, despite not having been accepted into the Temple, I returned the next day early to look for a space for myself again. I knew that in that place people were leaving soon and arriving at their destination. God was there, because many who were in that church arrived with their relatives or friends. In such a way that I insisted and stayed. Besides, I was also trying to be with my friend, who was already there. because we wanted to try to enter together. The idea was to cross and go to my mother's house, who has lived in Florida for several years. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> My arrival in Tijuana was on December 8, 2016. November and December, it can be said, were the months in which it was easier to enter the United States without being deported. It was like a time of grace. Something happened to Obama, probably because before that he had been declared as the US president who had done more deportations. Many of the Haitians benefited from such a sudden change, through which they were given access to that nation. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Some authorities asked for bribes; They started with $ 200 and eventually ended up charging 400. Who had them, because he paid them to enter before the assigned date. Many, without knowing it, were paying for their deportation. Especially those that happened in the months of September and October. In fact, the "coyotes" also did their job, and I couldn't mention any amount, but there were indeed Haitians who took that path; They had no luck. The charges were between five thousand and seven thousand dollars. Half here, half crossing. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Those who had their turn to appear at US immigration offices, waited a week, two weeks or even a month for the decision to be allowed to enter the United States or deported to Haiti. </p> </div>

<div> <p> From the moment we arrived1 in Tijuana, the INM agents explained that they could not give us papers to stay in Mexico. Actually that was not the goal we were pursuing. Some Haitians thought that the shelters received enough money from the government to help the migrant, and that is why it was not convenient for them to leave these places. For us, they were being benefited thanks to this town. We talked and thought that Mexicans wanted us to stay in the city to have black people in it. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Surely, as everywhere else, several shelters benefited from the departure that each government has for these matters. But not all. We discovered that in other places the pastors of other churches that had opened, were charging 200 pesos per night. They said it wasn't true, but it was. We knew it ourselves, we had acquaintances everywhere and we communicated constantly. Now that I think about it, it was logical, because they had no resources like the places established for migrant care. Somehow they had to cover the expenses generated by the Haitians. I can understand it. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> In the temple where we were there was no charge; It was a church established as a refuge, where it was the faith of the shepherds that succeeded in sustaining so many people. It was a shelter, say emergency, because they had the way to give us a place to sleep. Later we discovered that the shepherds had a foundation, which was Sfama Fundación Regalando Amor, A. C. However, their statutes did not say "migrants", but help disintegrated families and street children. Even so, through this foundation it was that help from the government arrived, but not with the same force as it arrived at the places of attention to the migrant. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The needs of food, blankets, mats, water and very convenient medical days were covered. At one time, there were countless altruistic groups that came to support, such as Los Angeles de Frontera, by Hugo. Castr. or. and Gaba Cortés, who are the ones I remember most. I thank the Tijuana community because they sympathized with us by providing all kinds of food, clothing, etc. I was impressed to see how day after day during those months God's blessings came to that place. Food was plentiful, this was one of the things that fascinated me most, obviously. I also had to see the collaboration of the World Organization for Migration (IOM), by Christopher Gascón. They provided the church with tables, chairs, pots of all kinds for cooking, knives and an industrial zinc to feed so many people. It really was a valuable help. </p> </div>

<div> <p> Of course, the help provided by Migrant Assistance, the Municipal Social Development Department, SEDESOL, the San Diego Methodist Church, by Pastor Elise, the Mission Siloe Foundation, Korean medical groups of. San Diego, an anonymous altruistic character who lives in Los Angeles, and of course the Tijuana community. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Different local churches attended our aid regardless of religion. There I saw Adventists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Catholics participate, and even atheists participated with their valuable collaboration. It was an incredible experience. After a while another institution called Espacio 'Migrante joined, in charge of Paulina Oivera Cáñez, which was given the task of seeking support from lawyers not only from the city, but from the United States. These supported us with. talks about our rights in Mexico, because they were already seeing that we could hardly cross and that many of us would get stuck in this country. ' That they provided us with that information was very significant for the Haitian people. I would like to mention all of them who got involved in this unimaginable work, 'but I don't remember everyone's names. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Something that caught my attention was the work of a young man named Terry and two of his friends; they were given the task of filling the church with mattresses for everyone. They came from Santa Monica, California - if I remember correctly. How did it cover that need, who took so many good mattresses that did not allow us to go cold? His work was very remarkable and I feel infinitely grateful for that. It provided comfort and rest. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Even with all this, many Haitians began to despair at the expectation of having an opportunity to enter the United States. In the Temple sometimes everything went out of control with the exits; It was very difficult to control so many people and everyone wanting to go, even if it wasn't their turn. Sometimes we calmed down, sometimes not. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The INM already knew that entering the United States for Haitians was going to get complicated and was aware of the number of deportees; So it made sense that we were presented with the option - right now - to stay here through a visa for humanitarian reasons. This option was not what we would have liked, but it was what we had on the table to drink. Some, seeing that things got difficult, after having suffered so much, inexplicably made the decision to be returned to Brazil or Haiti, so the government made it easier for them to travel. </p> </ div >

 <div> <p> Others like me have decided to stay in Tijuana. It was not an easy decision, especially for the effort and support-that our relatives had given us to make this trip in order to arrive with our families based in the United States, with the expectation that already being there we would reward them with our work. The majority acquired debts in Haiti with the bank, with their friends, with their relatives, or sold what little they had in order to pursue the "American dream". What a false illusion. After all this, returning was not fair. </p> </div>

<div> <p> In the end, I can say that it was a decision that God made, which compared to what we would expect in the United States, was the best. I have friends who are still imprisoned in some US jail. UU. waiting to be deported, and others already in Haiti. Sadly a large part of them did not live in Haiti. Some did not even have relatives there. They had been raised in Brazil, in the Dominican Republic or in Chile; I don't even want to imagine the triple suffering they experienced when they got there, to a country they didn't know, know where and know who. The first suffering was caused by leaving their place of origin and leaving everything to bet on nothing; the second, to reach a border city, not knowing anyone and seeking their survival; and the third, spend months in jail without being criminals, just for the simple fact of wanting to have a better life; live with real criminals and suffer again cold and hunger. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> In my case, I was hoping to earn more money than I earned in Brazil. There they paid us approximately 1300 reais a month, which would be like 300 dollars. But I discovered that here in Mexico that payment is a week or a fortnight, wonderful. I realized that here in Mexico money is not so important; You can eat well with little money. You can work and rest in the afternoon or work at night and rest in the morning. In the United States I would not have the peace that I have had to live in Mexico. I know there are people who must have up to three jobs to be able to support themselves. In addition, here there is no racism to the same degree as in the United States, we feel the respect of most people. I appreciated the advantage that here, seeing that we would not cross and that that was no longer an option, we found a way to work without papers and without any problems. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> As of January 10, 2017, the United States could no longer be entered. Only pregnant women and children had possibilities and, even so, many were deported, sadly some a few days after giving birth and ended up giving birth in Haiti. So staying was the only real option for around 5000 Haitian people who were living in Baja California. Currently, the figure has decreased because many requested their return; According to the information provided by the INM, we are tentatively here between 2500 and 3000. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> My perception of borders </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Brazil </p> </div>

<div> <p> We know that, across the world, border trade is one of the economic forces that each country shares with its neighboring country, but some of them cannot benefit from this opportunity due to lack of production. This is the case in the Americas, - generating poverty in many countries! </p> </div>

 <div> <p> "Most countries" in the Americas are connected by their borders, however, this does not prevent them from having major economic deficiencies. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> To begin this study, I crossed several countries and took the time to see that some exchanges take place in particular ways. Thus, Brazil is the only country that shares a border with France through the department of Guyana. The only two countries in South America that do not share a border with Brazil are Ecuador and Chile. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> We have not been able to visit all the borders shared by Brazil, but we conducted a visual study of the border trade between Bolivia and Brazil. These countries have very different imports in South America. Brazil is the most powerful distributor of agriculture in this region and Boiivia is one of the poorest countries in South America. This border has become increasingly insecure due to the exchange of cocaine that distributors in these states are doing. But clearly Brazil has always had its way of progress due to its livestock and agriculture, which are very powerful exchanges between them. However, this exchange seems to be more or less unique because Bolivia has almost nothing to offer Brazil, except immigrants. Brazil is also known as a country that opens its doors and welcomes immigrants, in the same way it is considered a superpower. Despite its fall in the World Cup, Brazil remains the leader of South America. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The border between Brasif and Peru is one of the most peaceful borders because trade does not take place in the same way as in Guyana (province of the French metropolis). Between Brazil and Peru there are fewer drugs. Peruvians use that border to enter and work because in Brazil, work is easier if compared to that of the countries of South America. Brazil is a place where anyone can get papers quickly and easily. '</p> </div>

 <div> <p> Peru-Ecuador </p> </div>

 <div> <p> On the border between Peru and Ecuador, the economic atmosphere is managed by a very active market. In almost every frontier studied, unfortunately, prostitution is one of the most widespread trades. This is well known. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Both countries have different currencies, Ecuador manages the US dollar, which still pushes a very large exchange with Peru. This undoubtedly gives a way of passage for drug traffickers and human traffickers who have made it even easier for immigrants from Brazil, Venezuela and Chile to cross the border. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Ecuador-Colombia </p> </div>

<div> <p> Colombia is known as one of the main cocaine producing countries in the world. On their shared border with Ecuador, for example, they used the mountains near the border to transport any type of illegal thing. Immigrants knew some of these roads because not everyone could go directly, so there were crossroads to cross. The houses there had an alarm system. In such a way that border crime was more popular than peace. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Colombia-Panama </p> </div>

 <div> <p> In fact, there is no border between Colombia and Panama, among them there is a forest called Darien Gap, which has the highest average number of traffickers who circulate their drugs. In general, these two countries do not share love with each other and there is only one possible passage to travel from Colombia to Panama, it is by air, because there is no other way to go, unless you decide to cross the entire forest that has about 160 km long Immigrants use this dangerous road to cross and enter the soil of Panama (more details in the book). </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Panama-Costa Rica </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Along all borders, the drug is very poorly controlled by the authorities because young people are smarter than they are. On the border between Panama and Costa Rica, the sale of marijuana is very popular. It gives the police more work, however, as something contradictory peace reigns across the border. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The populations of both territories are able to travel and return without any problem, which makes the vast circulation of drugs much easier. The. which turns out to be very favorable for all these unscrupulous people who come and go as they please. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Costa Rica-Nicaragua </p> </div>

<div> <p> Unfortunately it is the least pleasant place, people are not very friendly. The basis of its border is customs, because Costa Rica does not engage in any kind of relationship with its neighbor in the form of a market, as seen in other borders. For a Nicaraguan, it is mandatory to cross Costa Rican soil with a visa, because these two countries do not have the same economic level. Here things are handled differently, the Nicaraguan who lives in Costa Rica must have a residence card, otherwise he will be deported. It's that easy. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The only allowed trade in which you don't need documents is the prostitution market! </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Nicaragua-Honduras </p> </div>

 <div> <p> No one can describe the situation of the border between Nicaragua and Honduras, due to the way to cross into Nicaragua. Very few know what the realidat frontier is like, because it is one of the territories that has not been analyzed, not only because it is illegal to cross it, but also it was not accepted that immigrants put 'foot in their soil without having a visa. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Honduras-Guatemala </p> </div>

 <div> <p> ■ It is the quietest border we crossed because commercial activity was quite weak compared to other borders we were able to cross. The main objective of the trip was not to analyze the borders, but I, who am very observant, took it as part of my experience from the beginning to the end, every little detail mattered. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Guatemala-Mexico </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Mexico is the first country in North America when it comes through Central America. Guatemala is very open with Mexico - if one takes into account how the process was to cross the border - but the economic activities of the two countries share a very rich border trade, especially coffee. There was no big news compared to the other borders we had crossed, it was almost the same, but on a larger scale. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Mexico-United States </p> </div>

 <div> <p> The border between the United States and Mexico covers about 3200 kilometers, and extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Baptized as "the border tortilla", it is the busiest border in the world, with 181 million people who crossed the entire border shared with the United States of America (2015). </p> </div>

<div> <p> However, between 2016 and 2017 immigrants took two routes to cross through Baja California, which made it easier for them to reach their destination. This fact gave us a little more time to do a broader study on borders, particularly that of Tijuana. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> This border city plays a very important role. important in the economy of Mexico. It is one of the most sought after cities by immigrants; there is easy access, aj sex and drugs, which is why Americans enjoy a lot, in addition to its rich cuisine and culture. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Crime in this region is stronger than the armed forces, but this does not prevent the population from being happy. The heart of the city is the Revolution Street of happy Tijuana. Artisans and artists play a very important role in the image of the city. The economy of this border is dynamic, it can be said that a little gentle; but effective. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Reality </p> </div>

 <div> <p> I wonder sometimes: what do we really fear? To die, to hell, to illness or to failure? We know that you don't have to worry about failures, but about missed opportunities. In life one has two options and both are acceptable: to assume responsibility for our life and do our best with our possibilities in order to hunt the darkness; or leave you guide-by your own will, with which you will never stay in the dark. Because a fish inside a well cannot know the ocean. ■ </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Do not admit that your misery is already written, that this is your destiny; Our destiny is chosen by each one. We have a pencil and an eraser, and we have to know how to use them for fairer causes, but they won't be there every day. We have all made sacrifices in life because of money, sacrifices we never make for love. Learn that we are human, that we have a heart and that we just have to place our hands. on top of him to feel a beat that tells you that you are alive. That heart is your home, to which you will cease to enter the love of God, who will dwell there and replace hate and the devil. One chooses every day what is best, good and fair. Simply clean our heart to see all the riches we have, prosperity, future and our dreams. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> Stop looking anxiously at the places you can see, control your surroundings and focus on the opportunities. Realize them, one after another, and let your will and your inner peace make good decisions. Do not say that you do not have enough time, that it is best to shorten, take a quick alternative. Don't let people think for you, make your own decisions. Give importance to every minor detail, so you don't pay major consequences. You must find enough patience and perseverance. P. A. U. R: Patience, Love, Union, and Respect. And don't be a slave to your own goals; Always try to have a plan B. Do not give up what you have fought for just because everything did not go as you wanted or expected. </p> </div>

 <div> <p> After all, things don't depend on a person or money; Your happiness depends on the love you have in your heart. Learn to be confident in yourself and you will see that everything you can do, since that will feed you. </p> </div>
