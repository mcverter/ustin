  
The needs of food, blankets, mats, water and very timely medical days were covered. At one time, countless altruistic groups came to support, such as Los Angeles de Frontera, in Hugo's care. Castr. o. and Gaba Cortés, who are the ones I remember the most. I thank the Tijuan community for standing in solidarity with us by providing all kinds of food, clothing, etc. I was impressed to see how day after day during those months God's blessings came to that place. Food abounded, this was one of the things that fascinated me most, obviously. I also saw the collaboration of the World Organization for Migration (IOM), by Christopher Gascón. They provided the church with tables, chairs, pots of all kinds to cook, knives and an industrial zinc to feed so many people. It really was a valuable help,To be sure, the assistance provided by Migrant Care, the Department of Municipal Social Development, SEDESOL, the San Diego Methodist Church, run by Pastor Elise, the Siloe Mission Foundation, korean physician groups. San Diego, an anonymous altruistic character who lives in Los Angeles, and certainly the Tijuan community,Different churches in the town attended our aid regardless of religion. There I saw Adventists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Catholics participate, and even atheists participated in their valuable collaboration. It was an amazing experience. After a while he joined another institution called Espacio' Migrant, run by Paulina Oivera Cáñez, who was given the task of seeking support from lawyers not only from the city, but from the United States. These supported us with. talks about our rights in Mexico, because they were already seeing that we could hardly all cross and that many of us would get stuck in this country.' Having that information provided to us was very significant to the Haitian people. I'd like to mention to everyone who was involved in this unimaginable work, but I don't remember everyone's names,One thing that struck me a lot was the work done by a young man named Terry and two of his friends; they were given the task of filling the church with mattresses for all. They came all the way from Santa Monica, California - if I remember correctly. How did you do to meet that need, to whom you took so many good mattresses that we were not allowed to go through the cold? His work was very remarkable and I am infinitely grateful for that. It provided us with comfort and rest,Even with all this, many Haitians began to despair at the expectation of a chance to enter the United States. In the Temple sometimes everything was out of control with the exits; it was very difficult to control so many people and everyone wanting to go, even if it didn't take them a turn. Sometimes we'd calm down, sometimes we wouldn't,THE INM already knew that membership of the United States for Haitians was going to become complicated and was aware of the number of deportees; so it made sense to be presented with the option - right now - to stay here on a visa for humanitarian reasons. This option wasn't what we would have wanted, but it was what we had on the table to drink. Some, seeing that things became difficult, having suffered so much, inexplicably made the decision to be returned to Brazil or Haiti, so the government made things easier for them for their journey,

Others like me have decided to stay in Tijuana. It was not an easy decision, especially because of the effort and support that our relatives had given us to make this trip in order to arrive with our families based in the United States, with the expectation that already being there we would reward them with our work. Most acquired debts in Haiti with the bank, with their friends, with their family, or sold what little they had in order to pursue the "American dream". What a false illusion. After all this, coming back wasn't a fair thing,In the end, I can say that it was a decision that God made, which compared to what would await us in America, was the best. I have friends who are still in prison in some U.S. prison. But it's not the first time waiting to be deported, and others already in Haiti. Sadly, most of them did not live in Haiti. Some didn't even have relatives there. They had been raised in Brazil, the Dominican Republic or Chile; I don't even want to imagine the triple suffering they experienced when they got there, to a country they didn't know, know where and know with whom. The first suffering was caused by leaving his place of origin and leaving everything to bet on nothing; the second, to arrive in a border town, not know anyone and seek their survival; and the third, to spend months in jail without being criminals, just for the simple fact of wanting to have a better life; living with real criminals and suffering again cold and hungry,In my case, I was hoping I could make more money than I was making in Brazil. About 1300 reais, which would be like $300, was paid there. But I found that here in Mexico that payment is a week or a fortnight, wonderful. I realized that money here in Mexico is not that important; you can eat well with little money. You can work and'rest in the afternoon or work at night and rest in the morning. In America I wouldn't have the peace i've had to live in Mexico. I know there are people who must have up to three jobs to be able to sustain themselves. Besides, there's no racism to the same degree here as in America, we feel the respect of most people. I appreciated the advantage that here, seeing that we would not cross paths and that this was no longer an option, we found a way to work without papers and without any problem,As of January 10, 2017, you could no longer enter the United States. Only pregnant women and children had a chance, and yet many were deported, sadly a few days away from giving birth and ended up giving birth in Haiti. So staying was the only real option for about 5000 Haitians living in Baja California. Today, the figure has declined because many requested his return; According to the information provided to me by the INM, we are tentatively here between 2500 and 3000.

My perception of borders

Brazil

We know that, around the world, border trade is one of the economic forces that each country shares with its neighboring country, but some of them cannot benefit from this opportunity due to lack of production. This is the case in the Americas, -generating poverty in many countries!

"Most countries" in the Americas are connected by their borders, however, this does not prevent them from having major economic deficiencies.To begin this study, I crossed several countries and took the time to see that some exchanges are done in particular ways. Thus, Brazil is the only country that shares a border with France through the Guyana department. The only two Countries in South America that do not share a border with Brazil are Ecuador and Chile.We have not been able to visit all the borders shared by Brazil, but we carried out a visual study of the border trade between Bolivia and Brazil. These countries have very different imports in South America. Brazil is the most powerful distributor of agriculture in this region and Boiivia is one of the poorest countries in South America. This border has become increasingly unsafe due to the exchange of cocaine being carried out by distributors in those states. But clearly Brazil has always had its way of progressing due to its livestock rearing and agriculture, which are very powerful exchanges between them. However, this exchange seems to be more or less unique because Bolivia has almost nothing to offer Brazil except immigrants. Brazil is also known as a country that opens its doors and welcomes immigrants, as well as being considered a superpower. Despite his Fall of the World Cup, Brazil remains the leader-in South America.The border between Brasia fencing and Peru is one of the most peaceful borders because trade does not take place in the same way as in Guyana (province of the French metropolis). There are fewer drugs between Brazil and Peru. Peruvians use that border to get in and work because in Brazil work is easier when compared to south american countries. Brazil is a-place where anyone can get papers quickly and easily. 'Peru-EcuadorOn the border between Peru and Ecuador, the economic atmosphere is managed by a very active market. In almost every frontier studied, unfortunately, prostitution is one of the most widespread trades. This is well known,Both countries have different currencies, Ecuador handles the US dollar, which still pushes a very large exchange with Peru. This undoubtedly gives a way of way for drug traffickers and human traffickers who have made it even easier for immigrants from Brazil, Venezuela and Chile to cross the border.Ecuador-ColombiaColombia is known as one of the world's leading cocaine-producing countries. On their shared border with Ecuador, for example, they used the mountains near the border to transport any kind of illegal stuff. The immigrants knew some of these roads because not everyone could go directly, so there were crossroads to go through. The houses there had an alarm system. So crime at the border was more popular than peace,Colombia-PanamaIn fact, there is no border between Colombia and Panama, among them there is a forest called Darien Gap, which has the highest average of traffickers circulating their drugs. In general, these two countries do not share love with each other and there is only one possible passage to travel from Colombia to Panama, it is by air, because there is no other way to go, unless you decide to cross the entire forest that is about 160 km long. Immigrants use this dangerous path to cross and enter Panama's soil (more details in the book).

Panama-Costa RicaAcross all borders, the drug is very poorly controlled by the authorities because young people are smarter than them. On the border between Panama and Costa Rica, the sale of marijuana is very popular. Give more work to the police, however, as something contradictory, peace reigns across the border,The populations of both territories are able to transit and return without any problem, which facilitates much more the wide circulation of drugs. It's. which turns out to be very favorable for all these kinds of unscrupulous people who come and go as they please,Costa Rica-NicaraguaUnfortunately it is the least nice place, the people are not very friendly. The basis of its border is customs, because Costa Rica does not engage in any kind of relationship with its neighbor in the form of a market, as seen on other borders. For a Nicaraguan it is mandatory to cross Costa Rican soil on a visa, because these two countries do not have the same economic level. Here things are handled differently, the Nicaraguan living in Costa Rica must have a green card, otherwise he will be deported. That's how easy,The only trade allowed in which you don't need documents is the prostitution market!Nicaragua-HondurasNo one can describe the situation on the Nicaragua-Honduran border, due to the way nicaragua is crossed. Very few know what the realidat frontera is like, because it is one of the territories that is not analyzed, not only because it is illegal to cross it, but also it was not accepted that immigrants would put ' foot in their soils without having a visa.Honduras-GuatemalaIt is the quietest border we crossed because commercial activity was quite weak compared to other frontiers that we were able to cross. The main objective of the trip was not to analyze the borders, but I - who I am very observant - took it as part of my experience from the beginning to the end, every little detail mattered,Guatemala-MexicoMexico is the first country in North America when it is reached through Central America. Guatemala is very open with Mexico—if you take into account what the process of crossing the border was like—but the economic activities of the two countries share a very rich border trade, especially coffee. There was no great novelty compared to the other borders we had crossed, it was almost the same, but on a larger scale,

Mexico-U.S


The U.S.-Mexico border spans about 3,200 kilometers, stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Dubbed "the omelette of the border," it is the busiest border in the world, with 181 million people crossing the entire shared border with the United States of America (2015).However, between 2016 and 2017 the immigrants took two routes to cross through Baja California, which made it easier for them to reach their destination. This fact gave us a little more time to do a broader study on the borders, particularly that of Tijuana,This border town plays a very role. important in Mexico's economy. It is one of the cities most sought after by immigrants; there is easy access, aj sex and drugs, which is why Americans are very much counted, in addition to their rich cuisine and culture,Crime in this region is stronger than the armed forces, but this does not prevent the population from being happy. The heart of the city is Revolution Street of Happy Tijuana. Craftsmen and artists play a very important role in the image of the city. The economy of this border is dynamic, it can be said that a little peaceful; but effective,RealityI wonder sometimes: what are we really afraid of? To die, to hell, to sickness or to failure? We know that there is no need to worry about failures, but about wasted opportunities. In life one has two choices and both are acceptable: to take responsibility for our lives and to do our best with our possibilities in order to hunt the darkness; or leave you. guide-by your will, your own, with which you will never remain in darkness. Because a fish inside a well can't know the ocean. "Do not admit that your misery is already written, that this is your destiny; our destiny is chosen by everyone. We have a pencil and a draft, and we have to know how-to use them for fairer causes, but they won't be there every day. We have all made sacrifices in life because of money, sacrifices we never make for love. Learn that we are human, that we have a heart and that we only have to place our hands. on top of it to feel a heartbeat that tells you you're alive. That heart is your home, to which you will stop entering the love of God, who will dwell there and replace hatred and the devil. One chooses every day what is best, good and fair. It is enough to cleanse our hearts to be able to see all the riches we have, prosperity, the future and our dreams,Stop looking restless at the places you can see, control your surroundings, and focus on opportunities. Make them, one after the other, and let your will and your inner peace make good decisions. Don't say you don't have enough time, that it's best to shorten, take a quick alternative. Don't let people think about you, make your own decisions. Give its importance to every minor detail, so you don't pay for greater consequences. You must find enough patience and perseverance. The P. A.U. A: Patience, Love, Union, and Respect. And don't be a slave to your own goals; always try to have a plan B. Don't give up on what you fought for just because it didn't go all the way you wanted or expected,After all, things don't depend on a person or money; your happiness depends on the love you have in your heart. Learn to have confidence in you and you will see that everything you can do, since that will feed you,
