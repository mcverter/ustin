Rebirth of a new hope
To reach victory is to go through countless trials, struggles, falls, disappointments, pain; no one can say that he has achieved victory if he has not won all this first. We suffer a lot along the way, we suffered myriad afflictions, dismays. Likewise, we suffered injustices, humiliations, altercations, threats, assaults; we passed through the valley of death. That is why I can now say that everyone who came to Mexico is more than grateful to God and to life, because so far we can say ourselves victors,
It is sad to realize that only in need is it when man begins to invoke God, it is curious that we need to suffer some kind of anguish to turn to heaven and cry to God. And it's funny that after you've gone through all those torments and you're now working, in a place to sleep and without going hungry, you'll forget about him again.. Human beings have much evil within themselves, and we are quickly forgotten that we exist because of that infinite goodness of God,
For us it was convenient to arrive during their opening hours, i.e. from 8:00 a.m. M. 12:00 p.m. M. The taxi took us to the city center, from there we walked about four kilometers to reach the migration station. We were lucky that there weren't many people, it was just us, the people in the group,


Carrying out the permit procedure took all day, so we had to stay at the immigration station. Barely a month before, migration was denorating all Haitians, but when we arrived we were giving them leave to stay for a month. If you said you were from the Congo, you were stopped for at least a month. After we were granted permits, we had to look for a place to stay, because buses with routes from Tapachula to the north only departed twice a week, on Wednesdays and on Saturdays. We were able to find Plays where we were accommodated for two or three dollars a night. There were also places where we were not charged anything, but in return we had to hire them their transportation service, since they had trucks heading north, which cost $1200 pesos,We stayed a week to prepare before the trip. Not only to get fresh and clean to Tijuana, but also for our family members to send us more money. In the meantime, we use that time to get a little distracted, go for a walk and meet Tapachula. Every day was the same routine, eating, communicating with family, waiting for the day of departure and sleeping. There were some of the group who had enough money to go their way and went on. However, the rest of us were given the task of raising money until each person in the group had for the trip. In the end, we decided to leave on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. M. We just had ourselves. We had already lived through all those months, so we were becoming a real family; taking care of each other. This was, to say, the last push between everyone to Deny Tijuana and from there everyone would see how to cross to the United States,We went out in two trucks. we were hoping to get to know other places during the trip. The trip would last four days, but was delayed because one of the trucks had engine failed and took half a day to repair. We arrived in Tijuana at four and a half days. Along the way we communicated with friends who had previously refused to know where to go. The first Haitians who had arrived in Tijuana in the months of May, June, July and August had nowhere to stay and settled on the street, next to a place known as Father Chava's Breakfast Bar. The government of Tijuana never imagined that such a large number of foreigners would enter its doors in such a short period of time. Due to the number of Haitians, Africans, Muslims, etc. , which were coming to the right and sinister, was that other organizations such as the religious began to open, as well as their doors to house the number of people who were sleeping on the street.It was not something we could not do, we came from sleeping in the jungle, where you could be devoured, chopped, or die from a wild animal; so sleeping on the street and doing our needs in -- she was no problem. In the life of this city had passed through its streets a black exodus. It was also that Tijuana began to change its physiognomy. We were barbaric, countless. According to calculations by the North Border College, between 15,000 and 20,000 Haitians arrived at this border. The media reported the same. And the ones we stayed in Baja California, in September 2017 we were about 5000.class""photo">src"images/SobrevivSecondHalf-11.jpg"/At first, it was amazing to see migrants lying on the street in front of the dining room of Father Chava. Every time a migrant arrived in the city at the first place the taxi took him was to Father Chava's dining room because there was still no hostel willing to welcome us.Now I know that Tijuana is one of the cities where migrants from different parts of the world arrive the most. Whether it's to use it as a bridge to cross into the United States or, as we did, to settle here,

The first expressions of the Tijuanens when we were seen by their avenues were displeasure, of discontent, of discrimination. It looked like they'd never seen a. They had seen some in isolation, but not so many, and I admit that this was scary. On second thought, if he were in his position, he'd probably think the same thing. I know we didn't look our best at the time. And not all Haitians are good people, nor are all Mexicans. In this exodus, both good and bad came out of Haiti and Brazil,We arrive with a face of extreme tiredness, with a ferocious hunger, with health problems, with strong emotional problems; What we longed for was help! Bath, change and a place to rest for hours, rather than eat. We couldn't hold each other physically anymore,Very, far from what we wanted, what we wanted, was actually consisting of resuming strength, lining up next to Padre Chava's Breakfast, where they rightly installed a module of the Instituto Nacional ele "Migration" (INM), in collaboration with the Municipal Directorate of Attention to the Migrant in charge of the Lic. Rosario Lozada, who very kindly took care of us and sellated us the office of departure from Tapachula, which indicated the date to cross to the United States. And on one side they put a symbol that they couldn't, according to them, clone. Whether it was a circle, a star, a square, a diamond, a clover, all with their respective color, which could vary. This was very ingenious of you, but the Haitian has no limits, we could figure out how to modify everything. One of the things that we developed unfortunately on this journey was knowing how to manipulate the situation and put things in our favor,The INM sought ways to organize the outings jointly with the U.S. government to welcome us. So, the INM usually carried groups of about fifty people per day. In addition, this same institution, with the help of the Beta Group in charge of the Lic. Alejandro Salinas and his team, were the ones who distributed to the people in the hostels that were opening in different parts of the city,I connected with a friend who waited for me at Father Chava's Breakfast and from there directed me to a street called Alacrán Canyon, right where the Ambassadors Temple is located. Jesus. Honestly, I was already desperate and didn't want to go on hold with the assignments and distribution of groups to get to a hostel. In the Ambassadors of Jesus Temple - in charge of Pastor Gustavo Banda Aceves and his wife Zaida Guíííén López - as elsewhere, they were listed as they arrived and that's how they were going;-They gave priority to women with children , pregnant women and the sick to leave early,

The numbers used them not only to have a count of the people they were receiving, it also served to facilitate coordination with the INM in order to take people to the garita, since the groups could easily form them with the allocation of numbers. That way, migrants didn't have to line up to be given a date. I had been told that from there they came to leave up to thirty a day and that most of those who crossed, managed to reach their destination in the United States, which was mostly Florida, where they arrived with a family member or friend. Those who did not have this privilege made contact with a Haitian pastor who could receive them,The Ambassadors of Jesus Temple is a church; however, in the face of this emergency it became a refuge, so it worked in both ways,It was the largest shelter, it could hold up to 600 people. No where else had that capacity. The members of that church, especially the Ortega family, were the ones who were there day after day, distributing the places, providing blankets, personal grooming, handing out clothes, food, etc.The treatment was different, human, respectful, understanding, something we hadn't seen anywhere else except with the lady who felt empathy with us on one of the journeys. Here they would welcome people at any time, outside in the morning, at night or in the early morning. The door was never locked. But even if the door didn't close, many Haitians who just arrived ignored it, so many families who arrived at 2, 3 or 4 at morning and were going out and cold until dawn and offered them a place. Complete families. It was a truly impressive thing,In all the places we were there were countless rules, but there was apparently none here. Everyone else had hours to wake up, eat, bathe, go out, enter; Not here. There were two heavily regulated places; in one of them at five in the morning they would take you out with the cold it was, regardless of whether they were women with children or pregnant women. That was his norm. Moreover, it was not itself a hostel; they gave you breakfast and you had to roam the city until four or five in the afternoon, when they would give you entry again if you reached a place. There was another one who was pure men, where they would still take you out at five in the morning and at six in the afternoon you had to be back, to name a few examples. You understand, those were their rules and we had to respect them,However, in the Ambassadors of Jesus Temple, there was no such thing. You could come in at any time, but at nine o'clock the lights went out and everyone went to sleep. So they were the first few months because the shepherd and her husband worked, so they also had to rest a little. To put it somehow, their workday was continuous and endless, because if someone needed something in the early morning—which' was very common—they had to attend to it. So. who needed to have a break. As an indication of the time to sleep the shepherd sang a song, with which she hinted that we had to turn everything off; He said more or less this: "Until tomorrow, God willing, that you rest well, it was time to go to bed and to dream too, for tomorrow you know another day and you must live it with joy. . . ". It was unusual and very funny. We were laughing at her. Even though she was very strict with people, it turned out to have her crazy times,

However, I was unlucky that when I arrived there was no space. The shepherd told us several that she could no longer with so many and who had to send us elsewhere, so they referred us to the INM, which could only take us to the street in front of Father Chava's Breakfast. This was around eight o'clock at night and, in your luck you had to look for him where veruse, in a hotel or in another hostel. I contacted a friend who was staying near the line, where there were spaces in tents for the night,
"div class"photo">

Alanian Canyon, the Ambassadors of Jesus church, that hostel that received nearly half of Haitian migrants for more than six months. The church had more than five hundred Haitians among men, women, children; everyone was interested in getting there because it was the only shelter in dondoe migration sent ten to thirty people every day, meaning that more people arrived every day than they were leaving. There was always food and it was easy to obtain, but sometimes people spent more than four hours in the bathroom line, before Pastor Gustavo and his beloved wife—who are regarded as the protectors and relatives of Haitians, especially me—enlarged the facilitating the use of migrants. There are still about a hundred people in this hostel, to the point that the church started a project since the end of 2016, which they called Little Haiti.
But because I am a foolish and insistent man, despite not being accepted into the Temple, I returned the next early day to find a space for me again. I knew that in that place people would leave early and reach their destination. God was there, because many who were in that church came with their family or friends. So I insisted and stayed. Besides, I was also trying to be with my friend, who was already in that place,. because we wanted to try to get in together. The idea was to cross over and go to my mother's house, who has lived in Florida for several years,
My arrival in Tijuana was on December 8, 2016. November and December, you can say, were the months when it was easier to enter the United States without being deported. It was like a time of grace. Something happened to Obama, probably because before that he had been declared the american president who had made the most deportations. Many of the Haitians benefited from this sudden change, by which they were given access to that nation,

Some authorities were asking for bribes; they started with $200 and ended up charging 400. Whoever had them, because he paid them to enter before the allotted date. Many, unknowingly, were paying for their deportation. Especially those that passed in the months of September and October. In fact, the "coyotes" also did their job, and I could not mention some quantity, but indeed there were Haitians who took that path; they had no luck. The collections were between five thousand and seven thousand dollars. Half here, half crossing,Those who had their turn to run to U.S. migration offices waited a week, two weeks, or up to a month for the decision to be made to let them into the United States or be deported to Haiti.From the moment we arrived1 in Tijuana, the INM agents explained that they could not give us papers to stay in Mexico. That wasn't really the goal we were pursuing. Some'Haitians thought that the shelters received a lot of money from the government for helping the migrant, and that's why it wasn't in their interest for us to leave those places. For us, they were being benefited by this people. We talked and thought the Mexicans wanted us to stay in town to have black people in it,Surely, as everywhere, several shelters benefited from each government's departure for these matters. But not all of them. We found that elsewhere pastors from other churches that had opened were charging 200 pesos per night. They said it wasn't true, but it was. We knew it ourselves, we had acquaintances everywhere and communicated constantly. Now that I think about it, it was logical, because they had no resources like the places set up for migrant care. Somehow they had to cover the expenses generated by the Haitians. I can understand,In the temple where we were there was no collection; it was a church established as a refuge, where it was the faith of the shepherds that achieved the sustaining of so many people. It was a shelter, say emergency, because they had a way to give us a place to sleep. Then we discovered that the shepherds had a foundation, which was sfama Fundación Regalo Amor, A. C. However, their statutes did not say "migrants", but help disintegrated families and street children. Still, through this foundation it was that help came from the government, but not with the same force as it came to the places of attention to the migrant,

The needs of food, blankets, mats, water and very timely medical days were covered. At one time, countless altruistic groups came to support, such as Los Angeles de Frontera, in Hugo's care. Castr. o. and Gaba Cortés, who are the ones I remember the most. I thank the Tijuan community for standing in solidarity with us by providing all kinds of food, clothing, etc. I was impressed to see how day after day during those months God's blessings came to that place. Food abounded, this was one of the things that fascinated me most, obviously. I also saw the collaboration of the World Organization for Migration (IOM), by Christopher Gascón. They provided the church with tables, chairs, pots of all kinds to cook, knives and an industrial zinc to feed so many people. It really was a valuable help,To be sure, the assistance provided by Migrant Care, the Department of Municipal Social Development, SEDESOL, the San Diego Methodist Church, run by Pastor Elise, the Siloe Mission Foundation, korean physician groups. San Diego, an anonymous altruistic character who lives in Los Angeles, and certainly the Tijuan community,Different churches in the town attended our aid regardless of religion. There I saw Adventists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Catholics participate, and even atheists participated in their valuable collaboration. It was an amazing experience. After a while he joined another institution called Espacio' Migrant, run by Paulina Oivera Cáñez, who was given the task of seeking support from lawyers not only from the city, but from the United States. These supported us with. talks about our rights in Mexico, because they were already seeing that we could hardly all cross and that many of us would get stuck in this country.' Having that information provided to us was very significant to the Haitian people. I'd like to mention to everyone who was involved in this unimaginable work, but I don't remember everyone's names,One thing that struck me a lot was the work done by a young man named Terry and two of his friends; they were given the task of filling the church with mattresses for all. They came all the way from Santa Monica, California - if I remember correctly. How did you do to meet that need, to whom you took so many good mattresses that we were not allowed to go through the cold? His work was very remarkable and I am infinitely grateful for that. It provided us with comfort and rest,Even with all this, many Haitians began to despair at the expectation of a chance to enter the United States. In the Temple sometimes everything was out of control with the exits; it was very difficult to control so many people and everyone wanting to go, even if it didn't take them a turn. Sometimes we'd calm down, sometimes we wouldn't,THE INM already knew that membership of the United States for Haitians was going to become complicated and was aware of the number of deportees; so it made sense to be presented with the option - right now - to stay here on a visa for humanitarian reasons. This option wasn't what we would have wanted, but it was what we had on the table to drink. Some, seeing that things became difficult, having suffered so much, inexplicably made the decision to be returned to Brazil or Haiti, so the government made things easier for them for their journey,

Others like me have decided to stay in Tijuana. It was not an easy decision, especially because of the effort and support that our relatives had given us to make this trip in order to arrive with our families based in the United States, with the expectation that already being there we would reward them with our work. Most acquired debts in Haiti with the bank, with their friends, with their family, or sold what little they had in order to pursue the "American dream". What a false illusion. After all this, coming back wasn't a fair thing,In the end, I can say that it was a decision that God made, which compared to what would await us in America, was the best. I have friends who are still in prison in some U.S. prison. But it's not the first time waiting to be deported, and others already in Haiti. Sadly, most of them did not live in Haiti. Some didn't even have relatives there. They had been raised in Brazil, the Dominican Republic or Chile; I don't even want to imagine the triple suffering they experienced when they got there, to a country they didn't know, know where and know with whom. The first suffering was caused by leaving his place of origin and leaving everything to bet on nothing; the second, to arrive in a border town, not know anyone and seek their survival; and the third, to spend months in jail without being criminals, just for the simple fact of wanting to have a better life; living with real criminals and suffering again cold and hungry,In my case, I was hoping I could make more money than I was making in Brazil. About 1300 reais, which would be like $300, was paid there. But I found that here in Mexico that payment is a week or a fortnight, wonderful. I realized that money here in Mexico is not that important; you can eat well with little money. You can work and'rest in the afternoon or work at night and rest in the morning. In America I wouldn't have the peace i've had to live in Mexico. I know there are people who must have up to three jobs to be able to sustain themselves. Besides, there's no racism to the same degree here as in America, we feel the respect of most people. I appreciated the advantage that here, seeing that we would not cross paths and that this was no longer an option, we found a way to work without papers and without any problem,As of January 10, 2017, you could no longer enter the United States. Only pregnant women and children had a chance, and yet many were deported, sadly a few days away from giving birth and ended up giving birth in Haiti. So staying was the only real option for about 5000 Haitians living in Baja California. Today, the figure has declined because many requested his return; According to the information provided to me by the INM, we are tentatively here between 2500 and 3000.

My perception of borders

Brazil

We know that, around the world, border trade is one of the economic forces that each country shares with its neighboring country, but some of them cannot benefit from this opportunity due to lack of production. This is the case in the Americas, -generating poverty in many countries!

"Most countries" in the Americas are connected by their borders, however, this does not prevent them from having major economic deficiencies.To begin this study, I crossed several countries and took the time to see that some exchanges are done in particular ways. Thus, Brazil is the only country that shares a border with France through the Guyana department. The only two Countries in South America that do not share a border with Brazil are Ecuador and Chile.We have not been able to visit all the borders shared by Brazil, but we carried out a visual study of the border trade between Bolivia and Brazil. These countries have very different imports in South America. Brazil is the most powerful distributor of agriculture in this region and Boiivia is one of the poorest countries in South America. This border has become increasingly unsafe due to the exchange of cocaine being carried out by distributors in those states. But clearly Brazil has always had its way of progressing due to its livestock rearing and agriculture, which are very powerful exchanges between them. However, this exchange seems to be more or less unique because Bolivia has almost nothing to offer Brazil except immigrants. Brazil is also known as a country that opens its doors and welcomes immigrants, as well as being considered a superpower. Despite his Fall of the World Cup, Brazil remains the leader-in South America.The border between Brasia fencing and Peru is one of the most peaceful borders because trade does not take place in the same way as in Guyana (province of the French metropolis). There are fewer drugs between Brazil and Peru. Peruvians use that border to get in and work because in Brazil work is easier when compared to south american countries. Brazil is a-place where anyone can get papers quickly and easily. 'Peru-EcuadorOn the border between Peru and Ecuador, the economic atmosphere is managed by a very active market. In almost every frontier studied, unfortunately, prostitution is one of the most widespread trades. This is well known,Both countries have different currencies, Ecuador handles the US dollar, which still pushes a very large exchange with Peru. This undoubtedly gives a way of way for drug traffickers and human traffickers who have made it even easier for immigrants from Brazil, Venezuela and Chile to cross the border.Ecuador-ColombiaColombia is known as one of the world's leading cocaine-producing countries. On their shared border with Ecuador, for example, they used the mountains near the border to transport any kind of illegal stuff. The immigrants knew some of these roads because not everyone could go directly, so there were crossroads to go through. The houses there had an alarm system. So crime at the border was more popular than peace,Colombia-PanamaIn fact, there is no border between Colombia and Panama, among them there is a forest called Darien Gap, which has the highest average of traffickers circulating their drugs. In general, these two countries do not share love with each other and there is only one possible passage to travel from Colombia to Panama, it is by air, because there is no other way to go, unless you decide to cross the entire forest that is about 160 km long. Immigrants use this dangerous path to cross and enter Panama's soil (more details in the book).

Panama-Costa RicaAcross all borders, the drug is very poorly controlled by the authorities because young people are smarter than them. On the border between Panama and Costa Rica, the sale of marijuana is very popular. Give more work to the police, however, as something contradictory, peace reigns across the border,The populations of both territories are able to transit and return without any problem, which facilitates much more the wide circulation of drugs. It's. which turns out to be very favorable for all these kinds of unscrupulous people who come and go as they please,Costa Rica-NicaraguaUnfortunately it is the least nice place, the people are not very friendly. The basis of its border is customs, because Costa Rica does not engage in any kind of relationship with its neighbor in the form of a market, as seen on other borders. For a Nicaraguan it is mandatory to cross Costa Rican soil on a visa, because these two countries do not have the same economic level. Here things are handled differently, the Nicaraguan living in Costa Rica must have a green card, otherwise he will be deported. That's how easy,The only trade allowed in which you don't need documents is the prostitution market!Nicaragua-HondurasNo one can describe the situation on the Nicaragua-Honduran border, due to the way nicaragua is crossed. Very few know what the realidat frontera is like, because it is one of the territories that is not analyzed, not only because it is illegal to cross it, but also it was not accepted that immigrants would put ' foot in their soils without having a visa.Honduras-GuatemalaIt is the quietest border we crossed because commercial activity was quite weak compared to other frontiers that we were able to cross. The main objective of the trip was not to analyze the borders, but I - who I am very observant - took it as part of my experience from the beginning to the end, every little detail mattered,Guatemala-MexicoMexico is the first country in North America when it is reached through Central America. Guatemala is very open with Mexico—if you take into account what the process of crossing the border was like—but the economic activities of the two countries share a very rich border trade, especially coffee. There was no great novelty compared to the other borders we had crossed, it was almost the same, but on a larger scale,

Mexico-U.S


The U.S.-Mexico border spans about 3,200 kilometers, stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Dubbed "the omelette of the border," it is the busiest border in the world, with 181 million people crossing the entire shared border with the United States of America (2015).However, between 2016 and 2017 the immigrants took two routes to cross through Baja California, which made it easier for them to reach their destination. This fact gave us a little more time to do a broader study on the borders, particularly that of Tijuana,This border town plays a very role. important in Mexico's economy. It is one of the cities most sought after by immigrants; there is easy access, aj sex and drugs, which is why Americans are very much counted, in addition to their rich cuisine and culture,Crime in this region is stronger than the armed forces, but this does not prevent the population from being happy. The heart of the city is Revolution Street of Happy Tijuana. Craftsmen and artists play a very important role in the image of the city. The economy of this border is dynamic, it can be said that a little peaceful; but effective,RealityI wonder sometimes: what are we really afraid of? To die, to hell, to sickness or to failure? We know that there is no need to worry about failures, but about wasted opportunities. In life one has two choices and both are acceptable: to take responsibility for our lives and to do our best with our possibilities in order to hunt the darkness; or leave you. guide-by your will, your own, with which you will never remain in darkness. Because a fish inside a well can't know the ocean. "Do not admit that your misery is already written, that this is your destiny; our destiny is chosen by everyone. We have a pencil and a draft, and we have to know how-to use them for fairer causes, but they won't be there every day. We have all made sacrifices in life because of money, sacrifices we never make for love. Learn that we are human, that we have a heart and that we only have to place our hands. on top of it to feel a heartbeat that tells you you're alive. That heart is your home, to which you will stop entering the love of God, who will dwell there and replace hatred and the devil. One chooses every day what is best, good and fair. It is enough to cleanse our hearts to be able to see all the riches we have, prosperity, the future and our dreams,Stop looking restless at the places you can see, control your surroundings, and focus on opportunities. Make them, one after the other, and let your will and your inner peace make good decisions. Don't say you don't have enough time, that it's best to shorten, take a quick alternative. Don't let people think about you, make your own decisions. Give its importance to every minor detail, so you don't pay for greater consequences. You must find enough patience and perseverance. The P. A.U. A: Patience, Love, Union, and Respect. And don't be a slave to your own goals; always try to have a plan B. Don't give up on what you fought for just because it didn't go all the way you wanted or expected,After all, things don't depend on a person or money; your happiness depends on the love you have in your heart. Learn to have confidence in you and you will see that everything you can do, since that will feed you,
