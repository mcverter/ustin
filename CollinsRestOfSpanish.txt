They were looking for a way to put tents near the street or in a favorable location.Unfortunately Nicaraguan women also started doing their business with Haitians. Very smart of them, they rented a room where they took the men for 5 dollars with any of the women they chose, and even three or more were in a room. On the edge of those streets there was music and algarab√≠a. So much so that sometimes I wondered if I was really on a trip. There were so many things I could see that confused me. The fun of the world was a lot and you could say that because of these distractions we even felt at ease. It was strange that within the misery we were in ephemeral times could be happy,Coyotes charged a thousand dollars per person and got a hundred people or more, so their profit was $100,000. And they didn't just make one trip a week, but several. The profits of these people are huge,Coyotes are very smart. Sometimes the trips they charged didn't work, so at the border were the ones that had a long time. There were people who lost their money on poorly organized trips and were no longer able to recover anything.

In the case of those traveling on foot from Costa Rica to Honduras, some were successful, but most did not succeed.
